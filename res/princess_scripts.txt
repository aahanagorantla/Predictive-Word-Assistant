I
know
you
I
walked
with
you
once
upon
a
dream
I
know
you
The
gleam
in
your
eyes
is
so
familiar
a
gleam
Yet
I
know
it's
true
That
visions
are
seldom
all
they
seem
But
if
I
know
you
I
know
what
you'll
do
You'll
love
me
at
once
The
way
you
did
once
upon
a
dream
In
a
faraway
land
long
ago
lived
a
king
and
his
fair
queen
Many
years
had
they
longed
for
a
child
and
finally
their
wish
was
granted
A
daughter
was
born
and
they
called
her
Aurora
Sweet
Aurora
Yes
they
named
her
after
the
dawn
for
she
filled
their
lives
with
sunshine
Then
a
great
holiday
was
proclaimed
throughout
the
kingdom
so
that
all
of
high
or
low
estate
might
pay
homage
to
the
infant
princess
And
our
story
begins
on
that
most
joyful
day
On
that
joyful
day
On
that
joyful
day
Joyfully
now
to
our
Princess
we
come
Bringing
gifts
and
all
good
wishes
too
We
pledge
our
loyalty
anew
Hail
to
the
Princess
Aurora
All
of
her
subjects
adore
her
Hail
to
the
King
Hail
to
the
Queen
Hail
to
the
Princess
Aurora
Health
to
the
Princess
Wealth
to
the
Princess
Long
live
the
Princess
Aurora
Hail
Aurora
Hail
Aurora
Health
to
the
Princess
Wealth
to
the
Princess
Long
live
the
Princess
Aurora
Hail
to
the
King
Hail
to
the
Queen
Hail
to
the
Princess
Aurora
Thus
on
this
great
and
joyous
day
did
all
the
kingdom
celebrate
the
longawaited
royal
birth
And
good
King
Stefan
and
his
queen
made
welcome
their
lifelong
friend
Their
Royal
Highnesses
King
Hubert
and
Prince
Phillip
Fondly
had
these
monarchs
dreamed
one
day
their
kingdoms
to
unite
Thus
today
would
they
announce
that
Phillip
Hubert's
son
and
heir
to
Stefan's
child
would
be
betrothed
And
so
to
her
his
gift
he
brought
and
looked
unknowing
on
his
future
bride
Their
most
honored
and
exalted
excellencies
the
Three
Good
Fairies
Mistress
Flora
Mistress
Fauna
and
Mistress
Merryweather
Oh
Oh
The
little
darling
Your
Majesties
Your
Majesties
Your
Majesties
Each
of
us
the
child
may
bless
with
a
single
gift
no
more
no
less
Little
Princess
my
gift
shall
be
the
gift
of
beauty
One
gift
Beauty
rare
Gold
of
sunshine
In
her
hair
Lips
that
shame
the
red
red
rose
She'll
walk
with
springtime
Wherever
she
goes
Tiny
Princess
my
gift
shall
be
the
gift
of
song
One
gift
The
gift
of
song
Melody
her
whole
life
long
The
nightingale's
her
troubadour
Bringing
his
sweet
serenade
to
her
door
Sweet
Princess
my
gift
shall
be
the
Why
it's
Maleficent
What
does
she
want
here
Shh
Well
quite
a
glittering
assemblage
King
Stefan
Royalty
nobility
the
gentry
and
How
quaint
Even
the
rabble
I
really
felt
quite
distressed
at
not
receiving
an
invitation
You
weren't
wanted
Not
wa
Oh
dear
what
an
awkward
situation
I
had
hoped
it
was
merely
due
to
some
oversight
Well
in
that
event
I'd
best
be
on
my
way
And
you're
not
offended
Your
Excellency
Why
no
Your
Majesty
And
to
show
I
bear
no
ill
will
I
too
shall
bestow
a
gift
on
the
child
Listen
well
all
of
you
The
Princess
shall
indeed
grow
in
grace
and
beauty
beloved
by
all
who
know
her
But
before
the
sun
sets
on
her
sixteenth
birthday
she
shall
prick
her
finger
on
the
spindle
of
a
spinning
wheel
and
die
Oh
no
Seize
that
creature
Stand
back
you
fools
Don't
despair
Your
Majesties
Merryweather
still
has
her
gift
to
give
Then
she
can
undo
this
fearful
curse
Oh
no
Sire
Maleficent's
powers
are
far
too
great
But
she
can
help
But
Just
do
your
best
dear
Yes
go
on
Sweet
Princess
if
through
this
wicked
witch's
trick
a
spindle
should
your
finger
prick
a
ray
of
hope
there
still
may
be
in
this
the
gift
I
give
to
thee
Not
in
death
but
just
in
sleep
the
fateful
prophecy
you'll
keep
And
from
this
slumber
you
shall
wake
when
true
love's
kiss
the
spell
shall
break
For
true
love
Conquers
all
But
King
Stefan
still
fearful
of
his
daughter's
life
did
then
and
there
decree
that
every
spinning
wheel
in
the
kingdom
should
on
that
very
day
be
burned
So
'twas
done
Oh
silly
fiddlefaddle
Now
come
have
a
nice
cup
of
tea
dear
I'm
sure
it'll
work
out
somehow
Well
a
bonfire
won't
stop
Maleficent
Of
course
not
But
what
will
Well
perhaps
if
we
reason
with
her
Reason
With
Maleficent
Well
she
can't
be
all
bad
Oh
yes
she
can
Ooh
I'd
like
to
turn
her
into
a
fat
old
hoptoad
Now
dear
that
isn't
a
very
nice
thing
to
say
Besides
we
can't
You
know
our
magic
doesn't
work
that
way
It
can
only
do
good
dear
to
bring
joy
and
happiness
Well
that
would
make
me
happy
But
there
must
be
some
way
There
is
There
is
What
is
it
Flora
I'm
going
to
Shh
shh
shh
shh
shh
Even
walls
have
ears
Follow
me
I'll
turn
her
into
a
flower
Maleficent
Oh
no
dear
The
Princess
Oh
she'd
make
a
lovely
flower
Don't
you
see
A
flower
can't
prick
its
finger
It
hasn't
any
That's
right
She'll
be
perfectly
safe
Until
Maleficent
sends
a
frost
Yes
Eh
Oh
dear
She
always
ruins
your
nicest
flowers
You're
right
And
she'll
be
expecting
us
to
do
something
like
that
Oh
Well
what
won't
she
expect
She
knows
everything
Oh
but
she
doesn't
dear
Maleficent
doesn't
know
anything
about
love
or
kindness
or
the
joy
of
helping
others
You
know
sometimes
I
don't
think
she's
really
very
happy
That's
it
Of
course
It's
the
only
thing
she
can't
understand
and
won't
expect
Now
now
now
we'll
have
to
plan
it
carefully
Let's
see
The
woodcutter's
cottage
Yes
yes
the
abandoned
one
Of
course
the
King
and
Queen
will
object
But
when
we
explain
it's
the
only
way
Explain
what
About
the
three
peasant
women
raising
a
foundling
child
deep
in
the
forest
Oh
Oh
that's
very
nice
of
them
Who
are
they
Turn
around
Eww
Why
it's
us
Uhhuh
You
mean
we
us
Uhhuh
Take
care
of
the
baby
Why
not
Oh
I'd
like
that
Well
yyes
but
wwwe'd
have
to
feed
it
a
And
wash
it
and
dress
it
and
rock
it
to
sleep
Oh
I'd
love
it
Do
you
really
think
we
can
If
humans
can
do
it
so
can
we
And
we'd
have
our
magic
to
help
us
That's
right
No
no
no
no
no
no
No
magic
I'll
take
those
wands
right
now
Oh
better
get
rid
of
those
wings
too
You
mean
live
like
mortals
For
sixteen
years
Uhhuh
BBu
Now
now
we
we
don't
know
how
We've
never
done
anything
without
magic
And
that's
why
Maleficent
will
never
suspect
But
But
who'll
wash
And
cook
Oh
we'll
all
pitch
in
I'll
take
care
of
the
baby
Let
me
have
it
dear
Come
along
now
We
must
tell
their
Majesties
at
once
Flora
Flora
So
the
King
and
his
Queen
watched
with
heavy
hearts
as
their
most
precious
possession
their
only
child
disappeared
into
the
night
Many
sad
and
lonely
years
passed
by
for
King
Stefan
and
his
people
But
as
the
time
for
the
Princess's
sixteenth
birthday
drew
near
the
entire
kingdom
began
to
rejoice
For
everyone
knew
that
as
long
as
Maleficent's
domain
the
Forbidden
Mountains
thundered
with
her
wrath
and
frustration
her
evil
prophecy
had
not
yet
been
fulfilled
It's
incredible
Sixteen
years
and
not
a
trace
of
her
She
couldn't
have
vanished
into
thin
air
Are
you
sure
you
searched
everywhere
Yes
yes
uh
everywhere
We
all
did
Yeah
yeah
Uhhuh
yeah
And
what
about
the
town
The
forest
The
mountains
Yeah
we
searched
mountains
uh
uh
uh
uh
forests
and
uh
houses
and
uh
Let
me
see
Uh
and
all
the
cradles
Cradle
Yep
yep
Every
cradle
Cradle
Did
you
hear
that
my
pet
All
these
years
they've
been
looking
for
a
baby
Fools
Idiots
Imbeciles
Oh
they're
hopeless
A
disgrace
to
the
forces
of
evil
My
pet
you
are
my
last
hope
Circle
far
and
wide
Search
for
a
maid
of
sixteen
with
hair
of
sunshine
gold
and
lips
red
as
the
rose
Go
and
do
not
fail
me
And
so
for
sixteen
long
years
the
whereabouts
of
the
Princess
remained
a
mystery
While
deep
in
the
forest
in
a
woodcutter's
cottage
the
good
fairies
carried
out
their
welllaid
plan
Living
like
mortals
they
had
reared
the
child
as
their
own
and
called
her
Briar
Rose
On
this
her
sixteenth
birthday
the
good
fairies
had
planned
a
party
and
something
extra
special
for
a
surprise
Well
now
how
about
this
one
This
is
the
one
I
picked
Oh
she'll
look
beautiful
in
that
Now
I
thought
a
few
changes
here
Uhhuh
And
don't
forget
a
pretty
bow
Yes
and
raise
the
shoulder
line
We'll
make
it
blue
Oh
no
dear
pink
But
Of
course
we'll
need
a
few
pleats
Yes
but
how
are
we
gonna
get
her
out
of
the
house
Oh
I'll
think
of
something
Well
and
what
are
you
three
dears
up
to
Up
to
Up
to
Up
to
Uh
uh
ThThThe

But
don't
go
too
far
And
don't
speak
to
strangers
Goodbye
dear
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I
wonder
if
she
suspects
Of
course
not
Come
on
Oh
will
she
be
surprised
A
real
birthday
party
With
a
real
birthday
cake
Yes
and
a
dress
a
princess
can
be
proud
of
I'll
get
the
wands
Yes
you
can
uh
The
wands
Oh
no
No
magic
But
the
sixteen
years
are
almost
over
We're
taking
no
chances
But
I've
never
baked
a
fancy
cake
Oh
you
won't
have
to
dear
I'm
going
to
bake
the
cake
You
Oh
she's
always
wanted
to
dear
And
this
is
her
last
chance
Well
I'm
going
to
make
it
fifteen
layers
with
pink
and
blue
forgetmenots
And
I'm
making
the
dress
But
you
can't
sew
and
she's
never
cooked
Ohhoho
it's
simple
All
you
do
is
follow
the
book
Up
here
dear
You
can
be
the
dummy
Well
I
still
say
we
ought
to
use
magic
Flour
three
cups
Cups
cups
cups
cups
cups
cups
cups
Oh
One
two
three
What's
that
for
Well
it's
got
to
have
a
hole
in
the
bottom
That's
for
the
feet
to
go
through
It's
pink
Oh
lovely
shade
isn't
it
But
I
wanted
it
blue
Now
dear
we
decided
pink
was
her
color
You
decided
Two
eggs
Fold
in
gently
Fold
Uh
oh
well
I
can't
breathe
Let
me
out
of
here
It
looks
awful
That's
because
it's
on
you
dear
Now
yeast
one
tsp
Tsp
One
teaspoon
Oh
one
teaspoon
of
course
Hmm
Oh
gracious
how
that
child
has
grown
Oh
it
seems
only
yesterday
we
brought
her
here
Just
a
tiny
baby
Why
Merryweather
What
ever
is
the
matter
dear
After
today
she'll
be
a
princess
and
we
won't
have
any
Briar
Rose
Oh
Flora
Now
now
now
now
Well
we
we
all
knew
this
day
had
to
come
But
why
did
it
have
to
come
so
soon
After
all
we've
had
her
for
sixteen
years
Sixteen
wonderful
years
Oh
gracious
We're
acting
like
a
lot
of
ninnies
Come
on
She'll
be
back
before
we
get
started
You
hear
that
Samson
Beautiful
What
is
it
Come
on
Let's
find
out
Aw
come
on
For
an
extra
bucket
of
oats
And
a
few
carrots
Hup
boy
Whoa
No
carrots
I
wonder
I
wonder
I
wonder
why
each
little
bird
Has
a
someone
To
sing
to
Sweet
things
to
A
gay
little
love
melody
I
wonder
I
wonder
If
my
heart
keeps
singing
Will
my
song
go
winging
To
someone
Who'll
find
me
And
bring
back
a
love
song
To
me
Oh
dear
Why
do
they
still
treat
me
like
a
child
Who
Aunt
Flora
and
Fauna
and
Merryweather
They
never
want
me
to
meet
anyone
But
you
know
something
I
fooled
them
I
have
met
someone
Who
Who
Who
Oh
a
prince
Well
he's
tall
and
handsome
and
and
so
romantic
Oh
we
walk
together
and
talk
together
and
just
before
we
say
goodbye
he
takes
me
in
his
arms
and
then
I
wake
up
Yes
it's
only
in
my
dreams
But
they
say
if
you
dream
a
thing
more
than
once
it's
sure
to
come
true
and
I've
seen
him
so
many
times
You
know
Samson
there
was
something
strange
about
that
voice
Too
beautiful
to
be
real
Maybe
it
was
some
mysterious
being
a
wood
sprite
or
a
Here
stop
Why
it's
my
dream
prince
Your
Highness
You
know
I'm
really
not
supposed
to
speak
to
strangers
but
we've
met
before
I
know
you
I
walked
with
you
once
upon
a
dream
I
know
you
The
gleam
in
your
eyes
Is
so
familiar
a
gleam
Yet
I
know
it's
true
That
visions
are
seldom
all
they
seem
But
if
I
know
you
I
know
what
you'll
do
You'll
love
me
at
once
The
way
you
did
once
upon
a
dream
But
if
I
know
you
I
know
what
you'll
do
You'll
love
me
at
once
The
way
you
The
way
you
did
Once
upon
a
dream
Oh
Oh
I'm
awfully
sorry
I
didn't
mean
to
frighten
you
Oh
it
uh
wasn't
that
It's
just
that
you're
a
a
A
stranger
Mmhmm
But
don't
you
remember
We've
met
before
We
We
have
Why
of
course
You
said
so
yourself
Once
upon
a
dream
I
know
you
I
walked
with
you
once
upon
a
dream
I
know
you
The
gleam
in
your
eyes
is
so
familiar
a
gleam
And
I
know
it's
true
That
visions
are
seldom
all
they
seem
But
if
I
know
you
I
know
what
you'll
do
You'll
love
me
at
once
The
way
you
did
Once
upon
a
dream
Who
are
you
What's
your
name
Hmm
Oh
my
name
Why
it's
it's
Oh
no
no
I
can't
I
Goodbye
But
when
will
I
see
you
again
Oh
never
Never
Never
Well
maybe
someday
When
Tomorrow
Oh
no
This
evening
Where
At
the
cottage
in
the
glen
There
Ooh
Well
what
do
you
think
of
it
Why
it's
It's
a
very
unusual
cake
isn't
it
Yes
Of
course
it'll
be
much
stiffer
after
it's
baked
Of
course
dear
Um
what
do
you
think
of
the
dress
Well
iit's
uh
IIt's
not
exactly
the
way
it
is
in
the
book
is
it
Oh
I
improved
it
But
perhaps
if
I
added
a
few
more
ruffles
uh
Uh
what
do
you
think
Um
I
think
so
What
do
you
think
Merryweather
I
think
we've
had
enough
of
this
nonsense
I
think
we
ought
to
think
of
Rose
and
what
she'll
think
of
this
mess
I
still
think
what
I
thunk
before
I'm
going
to
get
those
wands
You
know
I
think
she's
right
Here
they
are
good
as
new
Ah
ah
ah
CCCCCCareful

Quick

the
doors

Fauna

They'll

But
We'll
put
them
all
to
sleep
until
Rose
awakens
Come
Sleeping
Beauty
fair
Gold
of
sunshine
In
your
hair
Lips
that
shame
The
red

rose
Dreaming
of
true
love
In

One
day
He

Riding

Rose
Prince
Phillip
Oh
Oh
Come
on
We've
got
to
get
back
to
the
cottage
Come
in
Well
This
is
a
pleasant
surprise
I
set
my
trap
for
a
peasant
and
lo
I
catch
a
prince
Away
with
him
But
gently
my
pets
Gently
I
have
plans
for
our
royal
guest
Maleficent
Maleficent
Maleficent
She's
got
Prince
Phillip
At
the
Forbidden
Mountain
But
we
can't
we
can't
go
there
We
can
and
we
must
What
a
pity
Prince
Phillip
can't
be
here
to
enjoy
the
celebration
Come
We
must
go
to
the
dungeon
and
cheer
him
up
Oh
come
now
Prince
Phillip
Why
so
melancholy
A
wondrous
future
lies
before
you
You
the
destined
hero
of
a
charming
fairy
tale
come
true
Behold
King
Stefan's
castle
And
in
yonder
topmost
tower
dreaming
of
her
true
love
the
Princess
Aurora
But
see
the
gracious
whim
of
fate
Why
'tis
the
selfsame
peasant
maid
who
won
the
heart
of
our
noble
prince
but
yesterday
She
is
indeed
most
wondrous
fair
gold
of
sunshine
in
her
hair
lips
that
shame
the
red
red
rose
In
ageless
sleep
she
finds
repose
The
years
roll
by
But
a
hundred
years
to
a
steadfast
heart
are
but
a
day
And
now
the
gates
of
a
dungeon
part
and
our
prince
is
free
to
go
his
way
Off
he
rides
on
his
noble
steed
a
valiant
figure
straight
and
tall
to
wake
his
love
with
love's
first
kiss
and
prove
that
true
love
conquers
all
Why
you
you
y
Come
my
pet
Let
us
leave
our
noble
prince
with
these
happy
thoughts
A
most
gratifying
day
For
the
first
time
in
sixteen
years
I
shall
sleep
well
Shh
No
time
to
explain
Wait
Prince
Phillip
The
road
to
true
love
may
be
barred
by
still
many
more
dangers
which
you
alone
will
have
to
face
So
arm
thyself
with
this
enchanted
shield
of
virtue
and
this
mighty
sword
of
truth
for
these
weapons
of
righteousness
will
triumph
over
evil
Now
come
We
must
hurry
Phillip
watch
out
Silence
You
tell
those
fools
to
No

Watch
out
Phillip

A
forest
of
thorns
shall
be
his
tomb
borne
through
the
skies
on
a
fog
of
doom
Now
go
with
a
curse
and
serve
me
well
'Round
Stefan's
castle
cast
my
spell
No
It
cannot
be
Now
shall
you
deal
with
me
O
Prince
and
all
the
powers
of
hell
Up
Up

way

a
dream

gleam

your
eyes
Is
so
familiar
a
gleam
Yet
I

it's
true
That

seldom
all
they
seem
But
if
I
know
you
I
know
what
you'll

You'll
love
me

Upon
A

well
That's
all
you
have
to
do
And
if
you
hear
it
echoing
Your
wish
will
soon
come
true
I'm

I'm
wishing
For
the
one
I

To
find

frighten
you
Wait
Wait
please
Don't
run
away
Now
that
I've
found
you
Hear
what
I
have
to
say
One
song
I
have
but
one
song
One
song
only
for
you
One
heart
tenderly
beating
Ever
entreating
Constant
and
true
One
love
That
has
possessed
me
One
love
Thrilling
me
through
One
song
My
heart
keeps
singing
Of
one
love
Only
for
you
Take
her
far
into
the
forest
Find
some
secluded
glade
where
she
can
pick
wildflowers
Yes
Your
Majesty
And
there
my
faithful
Huntsman
you
will
kll
her
But
Your
Majesty
the
little
Princess
Silence
You
know
the
penalty
if
you
fail
Yes
Your
Majesty
But
to
make
doubly
sure
you
do
not
fail
bring
back
her
heart
in
this
One
song
I
have
but
one
song
Hello
there
What's
the
matter
Where's
your
mama
and
papa
Why
I
believe
you're
lost
Oh
please
don't
cry
Come
on
perk
up
Won't
you
smile
for
me
That's
better
Your
mama
and
papa
can't
be
far
There
they
are
Can
you
fly
Goodbye
Goodbye
I
can't
I
can't
do
it
Forgive
me
I
beg
of
Your
Highness
forgive
me
I
don't
understand
She's
mad
jealous
of
you
She'll
stop
at
nothing
But
but
who
The
Queen
The
Queen
Now
quick
child
run
Run
away
hide
In
the
woods
Anywhere
Never
come
back
Now
go
Go
Go
Run
Run
Hide
Oh
Please
don't
run
away
I
won't
hurt
you
I'm
awfully
sorry
I
didn't
mean
to
frighten
you
But
you
don't
know
what
I've
been
through
And
all
because
I
was
afraid
I'm
so
ashamed
of
the
fuss
I've
made
What
do
you
do
when
things
go
wrong
Oh
You
sing
a
song
With
a
smile
and
a
song
Life
is
just
like
a
bright
sunny
day
Your
cares
fade
away
And
your
heart
is
young
With
a
smile
and
a
song
All
the
world
seems
to
waken
anew
Rejoicing
with
you
As
the
song
is
sung
There's
no
use
in
grumbling
When
raindrops
come
tumbling
Remember
you're
the
one
Who
can
fill
the
world
with
sunshine
When
you
smile
and
you
sing
Everything
is
in
tune
and
it's
spring
And
life
flows
along
With
a
smile
and
a
song
I
really
feel
quite
happy
now
I'm
sure
I'll
get
along
somehow
Everything's
going
to
be
all
right
But
I
do
need
a
place
to
sleep
at
night
I
can't
sleep
in
the
ground
like
you
or
in
a
tree
the
way
you
do
And
I'm
sure
no
nest
would
possibly
be
big
enough
for
me
Maybe
you
know
where
I
can
stay
In
the
woods
somewhere
You
do
Will
you
take
me
there
Oh
it's
adorable
Just
like
a
doll's
house
I
like
it
here
Ooh
it's
dark
inside
Guess
there's
no
one
home
Hello
May
I
come
in
Oh
What
a
cute
little
chair
Why
there's
seven
little
chairs
Must
be
seven
little
children
And
from
the
look
of
this
table
seven
untidy
little
children
A
pickaxe
A
stocking
too
And
a
shoe
And
just
look
at
that
fireplace
It's
covered
with
dust
And
look
cobwebs
everywhere
My
my
my
What
a
pile
of
dirty
dishes
And
just
look
at
that
broom
Why
they've
never
swept
this
room
You'd
think
their
mother
would
Maybe
they
have
no
mother
Then
they're
orphans
That's
too
bad
I
know
We'll
clean
the
house
and
surprise
them
Then
maybe
they'll
let
me
stay
Now
you
wash
the
dishes
You
tidy
up
the
room
You
clean
the
fireplace
And
I
will
use
the
broom
Just
whistle
while
you
work
And
cheerfully
together
we
can
tidy
up
the
place
So
hum
a
merry
tune
It
won't
take
long
when
there's
a
song
to
help
you
set
the
pace
And
as
you
sweep
the
room
Imagine
that
the
broom
Is
someone
that
you
love
and
soon
you'll
find
you're
dancing
to
the
tune
Oh
no
no
no
no
Put
them
in
the
tub
When
hearts
are
high
the
time
will
fly
So
whistle
while
you
work
Not
under
the
rug
So
whistle
while
you
work
We
dig
dig
dig
dig
dig

dig
In
our
mine
the
whole
day
through
To
dig

shovel
or

In

Where

We

A

Sometimes

Though

Hooray
Hah
Magic
Mirror
on
the
wall
who
now
is
the
fairest
one
of
all
Over
the
seven
jewelled
hills
beyond
the
seventh
fall
in
the
cottage
of
the
seven
dwarfs
dwells
Snow
White
fairest
one
of
all
Snow
White
lies
dead
in
the
forest
The
Huntsman
has
brought
me
proof
Behold
her
heart
Snow
White
still
lives
the
fairest
in
the
land
'Tis
the
heart
of
a
pig
you
hold
in
your
hand
The
heart
of
a
pig
Then
I've
been
tricked
The
heart
of
a
pig
The
blundering
fool
I'll
go
myself
to
the
dwarfs'
cottage
in
a
disguise
so
complete
no
one
will
ever
suspect
Now
a
formula
to
transform
my
beauty
into
ugliness
change
my
queenly
raiment
to
a
pedlar's
cloak
Mummy
dust
to
make
me
old
To
shroud
my
clothes
the
black
of
night
To
age
my
voice
an
old
hag's
cackle
To
whiten
my
hair
a
scream
of
fright
A
blast
of
wind
to
fan
my
hate
A
thunderbolt
to
mix
it
well
Now
begin
thy
magic
spell
Look
My
hands
My
voice
My
voice
A
perfect
disguise
And
now
A
special
sort
of
death
for
one
so
fair
What
shall
it
be
A
poisoned
apple
Sleeping
Death
I'd
like
to
dance
and
tap
my
feet
But
they
won't
keep
in
rhythm
You
see
I
washed
'em
both
today
and
I
can't
do
nothin'
with
'em
Hohum
the
tune
is
dumb
The
words
don't
mean
a
thing
Isn't
this
a
silly
song
for
anyone
to
sing
I
Oh
gosh
I
chased
a
polecat
up
a
tree
Way
out
upon
a
limb
And
when
he
got
the
best
of
me
I
got
the
worst
of
him
Hohum
the
tune
is
dumb
The
words
don't
mean
a
thing
Isn't
this
a
silly
song
for
anyone
to
sing
Watch
out
Be
ca
Watch
Watch
Watch
Watch
Thanks
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hooray
That
was
fun
Now
you
do
something
Well
what
shall
I
do
Tell
us
a
story
Yes
tell
us
a
story
A
true
story
A
love
story
Well
once
there
was
a
princess
Was
the
princess
you
And
she
fell
in
love
Was
it
hard
to
do
Oh
it
was
very
easy
Anyone
could
see
that
the
Prince
was
charming
The
only
one
for
me
Was
he
strong
and
handsome
Was
he
big
and
tall
There's
nobody
like
him
anywhere
at
all
Did
he
say
he
loved
ya
Did
he
steal
a
kiss
He
was
so
romantic
I
could
not
resist
Some
day
my
prince
will
come
Some
day
we'll
meet
again
And
away
to
his
castle
we'll
go
To
be
happy
forever
I
know
Hah
Mush
Some
day
when
spring
is
here
We'll
find
our
love
anew
And
the
birds
will
sing
And
wedding
bells
will
ring
Some
day
when
my
dreams
Come
true
Oh
my
goodness
It's
past
bedtime
Go
right
upstairs
to
bed
Wait
Hold
on
there
men
The
Princess
will
sleep
in
our
beds
upstairs
But
where
will
you
sleep
Oh
we'll
be
quite
comfortable
down
here
in
in
In
a
pig's
eye
In
a
pig's
eye
Sty
No
no
I
mean
We'll
be
comfortable
won't
we
men
Oh
yes
Mighty
comfortable
Now
don't
you
worry
about
us
We'll
be
all
right
ma'am
Go
right
on
up
now
my
dear
Well
if
you
insist
Good
night
Good
night
Princess
You're
sure
you'll
be
comfortable
Oh
yes
Very
comfortable
Well
pleasant
dreams
Pleasant
dreams
Let
go
I
saw
it
first
Now
men
don't
get
excited
Remember
share
It's
share
and
share
alike
Look
out
it'll
rip
It'll
rip
Bless
the
seven
little
men
who
have
been
so
kind
to
me
And
And
may
my
dreams
come
true
Amen
Oh
yes
And
please
make
Grumpy
like
me
Hah
Women
A
fine
kettle
of
fish
Dip
the
apple
in
the
brew
Let
the
Sleeping
Death
seep
through
Look
On
the
skin
The
symbol
of
what
lies
within
Now
turn
red
to
tempt
Snow
White
To
make
her
hunger
for
a
bite
Have
a
bite
It's
not
for
you
It's
for
Snow
White
When
she
breaks
the
tender
peel
to
taste
the
apple
in
my
hand
her
breath
will
still
her
blood
congeal
Then
I'll
be
fairest
in
the
land
But
wait
There
may
be
an
antidote
Nothing
must
be
overlooked
Oh
here
it
is
Love's
First
Kiss
No
fear

To

Goodbye

Goodbye
Oh

Goodbye
Some
day
when
spring
is
here
We'll
find
our
love
anew
And
the
birds
will
sing
And
wedding
bells
will
ring
Some
day
when
my
dreams
Come
true
Once
upon
a
time
in
a
faraway
land
a
young
prince
lived
in
a
shining
castle
Although
he
had
everything
his
heart
desired
the
prince
was
spoiled
selfish
and
unkind
But
then
one
winter's
night
an
old
beggar
woman
came
to
the
castle
and
offered
him
a
single
rose
in
return
for
shelter
from
the
bitter
cold
Repulsed
by
her
haggard
appearance
the
prince
sneered
at
the
gift
and
turned
the
old
woman
away
But
she
warned
him
not
to
be
deceived
by
appearances
for
beauty
is
found
within
And
when
he
dismissed
her
again
the
old
woman's
ugliness
melted
away
to
reveal
a
beautiful
enchantress
The
prince
tried
to
apologize
but
it
was
too
late
for
she
had
seen
that
there
was
no
love
in
his
heart
And
as
punishment
she
transformed
him
into
a
hideous
beast
and
placed
a
powerful
spell
on
the
castle
and
all
who
lived
there
Ashamed
of
his
monstrous
form
the
Beast
concealed
himself
inside
his
castle
with
a
magic
mirror
as
his
only
window
to
the
outside
world
The
rose
she
had
offered
was
truly
an
enchanted
rose
which
would
bloom
until
his
st
year
if
he
could
learn
to
love
another
and
earn
her
love
in
return
by
the
time
the
last
petal
fell
then
the
spell
would
be
broken
If
not
he
would
be
doomed
to
remain
a
beast
for
all
time
As
the
years
passed
he
fell
into
despair
and
lost
all
hope
for
who
could
ever
learn
to
love
a
beast
Little
town
it's
a
quiet
village
Every
day
like
the
one
before
Little
town
full
of
little
people
Waking
up
to
say
There
goes
the
baker
with
his
tray
like
always
The
same
old
bread
and
rolls
to
sell
Every
morning
just
the
same
Since
the
morning
that
we
came
To
this
poor
provincial
town
Good
morning
Belle
Morning
monsieur
Where
you
off
to
The
bookshop
I
just
finished
the
most
wonderful
story
about
a
beanstalk
and
an
ogre
and
That's
nice
Marie
the
baguettes
Hurry
up
Look
there
she
goes
The
girl
is
strange
no
question
Dazed
and
distracted
can't
you
tell
Never
part
of
any
crowd
'Cause
her
head's
up
on
some
cloud
No
denying
she's
a
funny
girl
that
Belle
Bonjour
Good
day
How
is
your
family
Bonjour
Good
day
How
is
your
wife
l
need
six
eggs
That's
too
expensive
There
must
be
more
than
this
provincial
life
Belle
Good
morning
I've
come
to
return
the
book
I
borrowed
Finished
already
I
couldn't
put
it
down
Have
you
got
anything
new
Not
since
yesterday
That's
all
right
I'll
borrow
this
one
That
one
But
you've
read
it
twice
Well
it's
my
favourite
Faroff
places
daring
sword
fights
magic
spells
a
prince
in
disguise
If
you
like
it
all
that
much
it's
yours
But
sir
I
insist
Well
thank
you
Thank
you
very
much
Look
there
she
goes
That
girl
is
so
peculiar
l
wonder
if
she's
feeling
well
With
a
dreamy
faroff
look
And
her
nose
stuck
in
a
book
What
a
puzzle
to
the
rest
of
us
is
Belle
Isn't
this
amazing
It's
my
favourite
part
Because
you'll
see
Here's
where
she
meets
Prince
Charming
But
she
won't
discover
that
it's
him
Till
chapter
three
Hey
hey
Hey
hey
hey
Now
it's
no
wonder
that
her
name
means
beauty
Her
looks
have
got
no
parallel
But
behind
that
fair
facade
I'm
afraid
she's
rather
odd
Very
different
from
the
rest
of
us
She's
nothing
like
the
rest
of
us
Yes
different
from
the
rest
of
us
is
Belle
Wow
You
didn't
miss
a
shot
Gaston
You're
the
greatest
hunter
in
the
whole
world
I
know
No
beast
alive
stands
a
chance
against
you
And
no
girl
for
that
matter
It's
true
LeFou
And
I've
got
my
sights
set
on
that
one
The
inventor's
daughter
She's
the
one
The
lucky
girl
I'm
going
to
marry
But
she
The
most
beautiful
girl
in
town
I
know
but
That
makes
her
the
best
And
don't
I
deserve
the
best
Well
of
course
I
mean
you
do
Right
from
the
moment
when
I
met
her
saw
her
l
said
she's
gorgeous
and
I
fell
Here
in
town
there's
only
she
Who
is
beautiful
as
me
So
I'm
making
plans
to
woo
and
marry
Belle
Look
there
he
goes
Isn't
he
dreamy
Monsieur
Gaston
Oh
he's
so
cute
Be
still
my
heart
I'm
hardly
breathing
He's
such
a
tall
dark
strong
and
handsome
brute
Bonjour
Good
day
You
call
this
bacon
What
lovely
grapes
Some
cheese
Ten
yards
Excuse
me
I'll
get
the
knife
Please
let
me
through
This
bread
it's
stale
Those
fish
they
smell
Madame's
mistaken
There
must
be
more
than
this
provincial
life
Just
watch
I'm
going
to
make
Belle
my
wife
Look
there
she
goes
a
girl
who's
strange
but
special
A
most
peculiar
mademoiselle
It's
a
pity
and
a
sin
She
doesn't
quite
fit
in
'Cause
she
really
is
a
funny
girl
A
beauty
but
a
funny
girl
She
really
is
a
funny
girl
That
Belle
Hello
Belle
Bonjour
Gaston
Gaston
may
I
have
my
book
please
How
can
you
read
this
There's
no
pictures
Well
some
people
use
their
imagination
Belle
it's
about
time
you
got
your
head
out
of
those
books
and
paid
attention
to
more
important
things
Like
me
The
whole
town's
talking
about
it
It's
not
right
for
a
woman
to
read
Soon
she
starts
getting
ideas
and
thinking
Gaston
you
are
positively
primeval
Why
thank
you
Belle
What
do
you
say
you
and
me
take
a
walk
over
to
the
tavern
and
take
a
look
at
my
trophies
Maybe
some
other
time
What's
wrong
with
her
She's
crazy
He's
gorgeous
Please
Gaston
I
can't
I
have
to
get
home
to
help
my
father
Goodbye
That
crazy
old
loon
He
needs
all
the
help
he
can
get
Don't
talk
about
my
father
that
way
Yeah
Don't
talk
about
her
father
that
way
My
father
is
not
crazy
He's
a
genius
Papa
How
on
earth
did
that
happen
Doggone
it
Are
you
all
right
Papa
I'm
I'm
about
ready
to
give
up
on
this
hunk
of
junk
You
always
say
that
I
mean
it
this
time
I'll
never
get
this
boneheaded
contraption
to
work
Yes
you
will
And
you'll
win
first
prize
at
the
fair
tomorrow
And
become
a
worldfamous
inventor
You
really
believe
that
I
always
have
Well

waiting
for
I'll
have
this
thing
fixed
in
no
time
Hand

that
The
doglegged
clincher
there
So

you
have
a
good
time
in
town
today
I
got
a
new
book
Papa
do
you
think
I'm
odd
My
daughter
Odd
Where
would
you
get
an
idea
like
that
I
don't
know
It's
just
that
I'm
not
sure
I
fit
in
here
There's
no
one
I
can
really
talk
to
What
about
that
Gaston
He's
a
handsome
fella
He's
handsome
all
right
and
rude
and
conceited
and
Papa
he's
not
for
me
Well
don't
you
worry
'Cause
this
invention's
gonna
be
the
start
of
a
new
life
for
us
I
think
that's
done
it
Now
let's
give
it
a
try
It
works

You

it
You
really

it
Hitch

fair
Goodbye
Papa
Good

Belle
Take
care

a
turn
I
guess
I
should've
taken
Wait
a
minute
No
Let's
go
this
way
Come

Philippe

a
shortcut
We'll
be

Lumiere

His

Hello
There's
a
stranger
here
Master
allow
me
to
explain
The
gentleman
was
lost
in
the
woods
He
was
cold
and
wet
so
Master
I'd
like
to
take
this
moment
to
say
I
was
against
this
from
the
start
It
was
all
his
fault
I
tried
to
stop
them
Would
they
listen
to
me
No
no
Who
are
you
What
are
you
doing
here
I
I
I
was
lost
in
the
woods
and
You
are
not
welcome
here
I
I'm
I'm
sorry
What
are
you
staring
at
Nothing
So
you've
come
to
stare
at
the
Beast
have
you
Please
I
meant
no
harm
I
just
needed
a
place
to
stay
I'll
give
you
a
place
to
stay
No

please
No
No
Oh

Belle's

the
surprise
of
her
life

Gaston
Yep

lucky
day
I'd
like
to
thank
you
all
for
coming
to
my
wedding
First
I

go
in
there
and
propose
to
the
girl
And

LeFou
now
when
Belle
and
I
come
out
that
door
I
know
I
know
I
strike
up
the
band
Not
yet
Sorry
Gaston
what
a
pleasant
surprise
Isn't
it
though
I'm
just
full
of
surprises
You
know
Belle
there's
not
a
girl
in
town
who
wouldn't
love
to
be
in
your
shoes
This
is
the
day
This
is
the
day
your
dreams
come
true
What
do
you
know
about
my
dreams
Gaston
Plenty
Here
Picture
this
A
rustic
hunting
lodge
my
latest
kll
roasting
on
the
fire
and
my
little
wife
massaging
my
feet
while
the
little
ones
play
on
the
floor
with
the
dogs
We'll
have
six
or
seven
Dogs
No
Belle
Strapping
boys
like
me
Imagine
that
Do
you
know
who
that
little
wife
will
be
Let
me
think
You
Belle
Gaston
I'm
I'm
speechless
I
really
don't
know
what
to
say
Say

marry
me
I'm
very
sorry
Gaston
but
But
I
just
don't
deserve
you
So
how'd
it
go
I'll
have
Belle
for
my
wife
Make
no
mistake
about
that
Touchy
Is
he
gone
Can

imagine
He
asked
me
to
marry

got

Belle
Papa
How

you
find
me
Your
hands
are
like
ice
We
have
to
get
you
out
of
there
Belle
I
want
you
to
leave
this
place
Who's
done
this
to
you
No
time
to
explain
You
must
go
Now
I
won't
leave
you
What
are
you
doing
here

Belle
Who's

Who

The
master
of
this
castle
I've
come
for
my
father
Please
let
him
out
Can't
you
see
he's
sick
Then
he
shouldn't
have
trespassed
here
But
he
could
die
Please
I'll
do
anything
There's
nothing
you
can
do
He's
my
prisoner
There
must
be
some
way
I
can
Wait
Take
me
instead
You
You
would
take
his
place
Belle

You

Please
Please
Master
What
Since
the
girl
is
going
to
be
with
us
for
quite
some
time
I
was
thinking
that
you
might
want
to
offer
her
a
more
comfortable
room
Then
again
maybe
not
You
didn't
even
let
me
say
goodbye
I'll
never
see
him
again
I
didn't
get
to
say
goodbye
I'll
show
you
to
your
room
My
room
But
I
thought
You
wanna
You
wanna
stay
in
the
tower
No
Then
follow
me
Say
something
to
her
I
hope
you
like
it
here
The
castle
is
your
home
now
so
you
can
go
anywhere
you
like
except
the
west
wing
What's
in
the
west
It's
forbidden
Now
if
you
need
anything
my
servants
will
attend
you
Dinner
Invite
her
to
dinner
You
will
join
me
for
dinner
That's
not
a
request
Who
does
she
think
she
is
That
girl
has
tangled
with
the
wrong
man
No
one
says
no
to
Gaston
Darn
right
Dismissed
Rejected
Publicly
humiliated
Why
it's
more
than
I
can
bear
More
beer
What
for
Nothing
helps
I'm
disgraced
Who
you
Never
Gaston
you've
got
to
pull
yourself
together
Gosh
it
disturbs
me
to
see
you
Gaston
Looking
so
down
in
the
dumps
Every
guy
here'd
love
to
be
you
Gaston
Even
when
taking
your
lumps
There's
no
man
in
town
as
admired
as
you
You're
everyone's
favourite
guy
Everyone's
awed
and
inspired
by
you
And
it's
not
very
hard
To
see
why
No
one's
slick
as
Gaston
No
one's
quick
as
Gaston
No
one's
neck's
as
incredibly
thick
as
Gaston
For
there's
no
man
in
town
half
as
manly
Perfect
a
pure
paragon
You
can
ask
any
Tom
dck
or
Stanley
And
they'll
tell
you
whose
team
they
prefer
to
be
on
No
one's
been
like
Gaston
A
kingpin
like
Gaston
No
one's
got
a
swell
cleft
in
his
chin
like
Gaston
As
a
specimen
yes
I'm
intimidating
My
what
a
guy
that
Gaston
Give
five
hurrahs
Give
hiphips
Gaston
is
the
best
and
the
rest
is
all
drips
No
one
fights
like
Gaston
Douses
lights
like
Gaston
In
a
wrestling
match
nobody
bites
like
Gaston
For
there's
no
one
as
burly
and
brawny
As
you
see
I've
got
biceps
to
spare
Not
a
bit
of
him
scraggly
or
scrawny
That's
right
And
every
last
inch
of
me's
covered
with
hair
No
one
hits
like
Gaston
Matches
wits
like
Gaston
In
a
spitting
match
nobody
spits
like
Gaston
I'm
especially
good
at
expectorating
Ten
points
for
Gaston
When
I
was
a
lad
l
ate
four
dozen
eggs
Every
morning
to
help
me
get
large
And
now
that
I'm
grown
l
eat
five
dozen
eggs
So
I'm
roughly
the
size
of
a
barge
No
one
sht
like
Gaston
Makes
those
beauts
like
Gaston
Then
goes
tromping
around
wearing
boots
like
Gaston
l
use
antlers
in
all
of
my
decorating
My
what
a
guy
Gaston
Help
Someone
help
me
Maurice
Please
Please
I
need
your
help
He's
got
her
He's
got
her
locked
in
the
dungeon
Who
Belle
We
must
go
Not
Not
a
minute
to
lose
Whoa
Slow
down
Maurice
Who's
got
Belle
locked
in
a
dungeon
A
beast
A
horrible
monstrous
beast
Is
it
a
big
beast
Huge
With
a
long
ugly
snout
Hideously
ugly
And
sharp
cruel
fangs
Yes
yes
Will
you
help
me
All
right
old
man
We'll
help
you
out
You
will
Thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
Crazy
old
Maurice
He's
always
good
for
a
laugh
Crazy
old
Maurice
Crazy
old
Maurice
LeFou
I'm
afraid
I've
been
thinking
A
dangerous
pastime
l
Know
But
that
wacky
old
coot
is
Belle's
father
And
his
sanity's
only
soso
Now
the
wheels
in
my
head
have
been
turning
Since
I
looked
at
that
loony
old
man
See
I
promised
myself
I'd
be
married
to
Belle
And
right
now
I'm
evolving
a
plan
If
I
Yes
Then
we
No
would
she
Guess
Now
I
get
it
Let's
go
Let's
go
No
one
plots
like
Gaston
Takes
cheap
shts
like
Gaston
Plans
to
persecute
harmless
crackpots
like
Gaston
So
his
marriage
we
soon
will
be
celebrating
My
what
a
guy
Gaston
Will
no
one
help
me
Who
is
it
Mrs
Potts
dear
I
thought
you
might
like
a
spot
of
tea
But
you're
You're
a
Careful
This
is
impossible
I
know
it
is
but
here
we
are
I
told
you
she
was
pretty
Mama
didn't
I
All
right
Chip
now
that'll
do
Slowly
now
Don't
spill
Thank
you
Wanna
see
me
do
a
trick
Chip
Sorry
That
was
a
very
brave
thing
you
did
my
dear
We
all
think
so
But
I've
lost
my
father
my
dreams
everything
Cheer
up
child
It'll
turn
out
all
right
in
the
end
You'll
see
Listen
to
me
jabbering
on
while
there's
a
supper
to
get
on
the
table
Chip
Bye
Well
now
what
shall
we
dress
you
in
for
dinner
Let's
see
what
I
got
in
my
drawers
How
embarrassing
Here
we
are
You'll
look
ravishing
in
this
one
That's
very
kind
of
you
but
I'm
not
going
to
dinner
But
you
must
Dinner
is
served
What's
taking
so
long
I
told
her
to
come
down
Why
isn't
she
here
yet
Try
to
be
patient
sir
The
girl
has
lost
her
father
and
her
freedom
all
in
one
day
Master
have
you
thought
that
perhaps
this
girl
could
be
the
one
to
break
the
spell
Of
course
I
have
I'm
not
a
fool
Good
So
you
fall
in
love
with
her
she
falls
in
love
with
you
and
poof
The
spell
is
broken
We'll
be
human
again
by
midnight
It's
not
that
easy
Lumiere
These
things
take
time
But
the
rose
has
already
begun
to
wilt
It's
no
use
She's
so
beautiful
and
I'm
Well
look
at
me
You
must
help
her
to
see
past
all
that
I
don't
know
how
Well
you
can
start
by
making
yourself
more
presentable
Straighten
up
Try
to
act
like
a
gentleman
Yes
When
she
comes
in
give
her
a
dashing
debonair
smile
Come
come
show
me
the
smile
But
don't
frighten
the
poor
girl
Impress
her
with
your
rapier
wit
But
be
gentle
Shower
her
with
compliments
But
be
sincere
And
above
all
you
must
control
your
temper
You
must
control
your
temper
Here
she
is
Good
evening
Well
where
is
she
Who
The
girl
yes
The
girl
Well
actually
she's
in
the
process
of
Circumstances
being
what
they
are
She's
not
coming
What
Oh
dear
Your
Grace
Your
Eminence
Let's
not
be
hasty
I
thought
I
told
you
to
come
down
to
dinner
I'm
not
hungry
You'll
come
out
or
I'll
I'll
I'll
break
down
the
door
Master
I
could
be
wrong
but
that
may
not
be
the
best
way
to
win
the
girl's
affections
Please
attempt
to
be
a
gentleman
But
she
is
being
so
difficult
Gently
gently
Will
you
come
down
to
dinner
No
Suave
genteel
It
would
give
me
great
pleasure
if
you
would
join
me
for
dinner
And
we
say
please
Please
No
thank
you
You
can't
stay
in
there
forever
Yes
I
can
Fine
Then
go
ahead
and
starve
If
she
doesn't
eat
with
me
then
she
doesn't
eat
at
all
Oh
dear
That
didn't
go
very
well
at
all
did
it
Lumiere
stand
watch
at
the
door
and
inform
me
at
once
if
there
is
the
slightest
change
You
can
count
on
me
mon
capitaine
Well
we
might
as
well
go
downstairs
and
start
cleaning
up
I
ask
nicely
but
she
refuses
What
does
she
want
me
to
do
beg
Show
me
the
girl
But
the
master's
really
not
so
bad
once
you
get
to
know
him
Why
don't
you
give
him
a
chance
l
don't
want
to
get
to
know
him
l
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
I'm
just
fooling
myself
She'll
never
see
me
as
anything
but
a
monster
It's
hopeless
Oh
no
Oh
yes
Oh
no
Oh
yes
yes
yes
I've
been
burned
by
you
before
Zut
alors
She
has
emerged
Come
on
Chip
Into
the
cupboard
with
your
brothers
and
sisters
But
I'm
not
sleepy
Yes
you
are
No
I'm
not
I
work
and
I
slve
all
day
long
and
for
what
A
culinary
masterpiece
gone
to
waste
Stop
your
grousing
It's
been
a
long
night
for
all
of
us
Well
if
you
ask
me
she
was
just
being
stubborn
After
all
he
did
say
please
But
if
the
master
doesn't
learn
to
control
that
temper
he'll
never
break
the
Splendid
to
see
you
out
and
about
mademoiselle
I
am
Cogsworth
head
of
the
household
This
is
Lumiere
Enchante
cherie
If
there's
stop
that
anything
we
please
can
do
to
make
your
stay
more
comfortable
I
am
a
little
hungry
You
are
Hear
that
She's
hungry
Stoke
the
fire
Break
out
the
silver
Wake
the
china
Remember
what
the
master
said
Pish
tosh
I'm
not
about
to
let
the
poor
child
go
hungry
All
right
fine
Glass
of
water
crust
of
bread
and
then
Cogsworth
I
am
surprised
at
you
She's
not
a
prisoner
She's
our
guest
We
must
make
her
feel
welcome
here
Right
this
way
mademoiselle
Well
keep
it
down
If
the
master
finds
out
about
this
it
will
be
our
necks
Of
course
of
course
But
what
is
dinner
without
a
little
music
Music
It
is
with
deepest
pride
and
greatest
pleasure
that
we
welcome
you
tonight
And
now
we
invite
you
to
relax
Let
us
pull
up
a
chair
as
the
dining
room
proudly
presents
your
dinner
Be
our
guest
be
our
guest
Put
our
service
to
the
test
Tie
your
napkin
'round
your
neck
cherie
And
we
provide
the
rest
Soup
du
jour
hot
hors
d'oeuvres
Why
we
only
live
to
serve
Try
the
gray
stuff
it's
delicious
Don't
believe
me
Ask
the
dishes
They
can
sing
they
can
dance
After
all
miss
this
is
France
And
a
dinner
here
is
never
second
best
Go
on
unfold
your
menu
Take
a
glance
and
then
you'll
be
our
guest
Oui
our
guest
Be
our
guest
Beef
ragout
cheese
souffl
Pie
and
pudding
en
flamb
We'll
prepare
and
serve
with
flair
A
culinary
cabaret
You're
alone
and
you're
scared
But
the
banquet's
all
prepared
No
one's
gloomy
or
complaining
While
the
flatware's
entertaining
We
tell
jokes
I
do
tricks
With
my
fellow
candlesticks
Und
it's
all
in
perfect
taste
That
you
can
bet
Come
on
and
lift
your
glass
You've
won
your
own
free
pass
To
be
our
guest
If
you're
stressed
it's
fine
dining
we
suggest
Be
our
guest
be
our
guest
Be
our
guest
Life
is
so
unnerving
For
a
servant
who's
not
serving
He's
not
whole
without
a
soul
to
wait
upon
Get
off
Those
good
old
days
When
we
were
useful
Suddenly
those
good
old
days
are
gone
Ten
years
we've
been
rusting
Needing
so
much
more
than
dusting
Needing
exercise
A
chance
to
use
our
skills
Most
days
we
just
lay
around
the
castle
Flabby
fat
and
lazy
You
walked
in
and
oopsadaisy
It's
a
guest
it's
a
guest
Sakes
alive
well
I'll
be
blessed
Wine's
been
poured
and
thank
the
Lord
I've
had
the
napkins
freshly
pressed
With
dessert
she'll
want
tea
And
my
dear
that's
fine
with
me
While
the
cups
do
their
softshoeing
I'll
be
bubbling
I'll
be
brewing
I'll
get
warm
piping
hot
Heaven
sakes
is
that
a
spot
Clean
it
up
We
want
the
company
impressed
We've
got
a
lot
to
do
Is
it
one
lump
or
two
For
you
our
guest
She's
our
guest
She's
our
guest
Be
our
guest
Be
our
guest

our
guest
Our
command
is
your
request
Let's

Fun's

Line

It's
years
since
we've
had
anybody
here
And
we're
obsessed
With
your
meal
with
your
ease
Yes
indeed
we
aim
to
please
While
the
candlelight's
still
glowing
Let
us
help
you
we'll
keep
going
Course
by
course
One
by
one
Till
you
shout
Enough
I'm
done
Then
we'll
sing
you
off
to
sleep
as
you
digest
Tonight
you'll
prop
your
feet
up
But
for
now
let's
eat
up
Be
our
guest
Please
be
our
Guest
Bravo
That
was
wonderful
Thank
you
Thank
you
mademoiselle
Good
show
wasn't
it
Everyone
My
goodness
look
at
the
time
Now
it's
off
to
bed
off
to
bed
I
couldn't
possibly
go
to
bed
now
It's
my
first
time
in
an
enchanted
castle
Enchanted
Who
said
anything
about
the
castle
being
enchanted
It
was
you
wasn't
it
I
figured
it
out
for
myself
I'd
like
to
look
around
if
that's
all
right
Would
you
like
a
tour
Wait
a
second
Wait
a
second
I'm
not
sure
that's
such
a
good
idea
We
can't
let
her
go
poking
around
in
certain
places
if
you
know
what
I
mean
Perhaps
you'd
like
to
take
me
I'm
sure
you
know
everything
there
is
to
know
about
the
castle
Well
Actually
I
Yes
I
do
As
you
can
see
the
pseudofacade
was
stripped
away
to
reveal
the
minimalist
Rococo
design
Note
the
unusual
inverted
vaulted
ceilings
This
is
yet
another
example
of
the
lateneoclassic
Baroque
period
And
as
I
always
say
if
it's
not
Baroque
don't
fix
it
Where
was
I
As
you
were
Now
then
if
I
may
draw
your
attention
to
the
flying
buttresses
above
the
Mademoiselle
What's
up
there
Where
There
Nothing
Absolutely
nothing
of
interest
at
all
in
the
west
wing
Dusty
dull
very
boring
So
that's
the
west
wing
Nice
going
I
wonder
what
he's
hiding
up
there
Hiding
The
master
is
hiding
nothing
Then
it
wouldn't
be
forbidden
Perhaps
mademoiselle
would
like
to
see
something
else
We
have
exquisite
tapestries
dating
all
the
way
back
to
Maybe
later
The
gardens
Or
Or
the
The
library
perhaps
You
have
a
library
Yes
Indeed
With
books
Scads
of
books
Mountains
of
books
Forests
of
books
Cascades
Cloudbursts
Swamps
of
books
More
books
than
you'll
ever
be
able
to
read
in
a
lifetime
Books
on
every
subject
ever
studied
by
every
author
who
ever
set
pen
to
paper
Why
did
you
come
here
I'm
I'm
sorry
I
warned
you
never
to
come
here
I
didn't
mean
any
harm
Do
you
realize
what
you
could
have
done
Please
Stop
Get
out
No
Get
out
Where
are
you
going
Promise
or
no
promise
I
can't
stay
here
another
minute
No
wait
please
Please
wait
No
Here
now
Don't
do
that
Just
hold
still
That
hurts
If
you'd
hold
still
it
wouldn't
hurt
as
much
Well
if
you
hadn't
have
run
away
this
wouldn't
have
happened
If
you
hadn't
frightened
me
I
wouldn't
have
run
away
Well
you
shouldn't
have
been
in
the
west
wing
Well
you
should
learn
to
control
your
temper
Now
hold
still
This
might
sting
a
little
By
the
way
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
You're
welcome
I
don't
usually
leave
the
asylum
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
he
said
you'd
make
it
worth
my
while
I'm
listening
It's
like
this
I've
got
my
heart
set
on
marrying
Belle
but
she
needs
a
little
persuasion
Turned
him
down
flat
Everyone
knows
her
father's
a
lunatic
He
was
in
here
tonight
raving
about
a
beast
in
a
castle
Maurice
is
harmless
The
point
is
Belle
would
do
anything
to
keep
him
from
being
locked
up
Yeah
even
marry
him
So
you
want
me
to
throw
her
father
into
the
asylum
unless
she
agrees
to
marry
you
That
is
despicable
I
love
it
If
no
one
will
help
me
then
I'll
go
back
alone
Yes
is
that
everything
I
don't
care
what
it
takes
I'll
find
that
castle
and
somehow
I
I'll
get
her
out
of
there
Belle
Maurice
Oh
well
Guess
it's
not
gonna
work
after
all
They
have
to
come
back
sometime
And
when
they
do
we'll
be
ready
for
them
LeFou
don't
move
from
that
spot
until
Belle
and
her
father
come
home
But
But
I
Nuts
I've
never
felt
this
way
about
anyone
I
want
to
do
something
for
her
But
what
Well
there's
the
usual
things
Flowers
chocolates
promises
you
don't
intend
to
keep
No
no
It
has
to
be
something
very
special
Something
that
sparks
her
interest
Wait
a
minute
Belle
There's
something
I
want
to
show
you
But
first
you
have
to
close
your
eyes
It's
a
surprise
Can
I
open
them
No
no
Not
yet
Wait
here
Now
can
I
open
them
All
right
Now
I
can't
believe
it
I've
never
seen
so
many
books
in
all
my
life
You
You
like
it
It's
wonderful
Then
it's
yours
Thank
you
so
much
Would
you
look
at
that
I
knew
it
would
work
What
What
works
It's
very
encouraging
Isn't
this
exciting
I
didn't
see
anything
Come
along
Chip
There's
chores
to
be
done
in
the
kitchen
But
what
are
they
talking
about
What's
going
on
Come
on
Mom
There's
something
sweet
and
almost
kind
But
he
was
mean
and
he
was
coarse
and
unrefined
And
now
he's
dear
and
so
unsure
I
wonder
why
l
didn't
see
it
there
before
She
glanced
this
way
l
thought
I
saw
And
when
we
touched
she
didn't
shudder
at
my
paw
No
it
can't
be
I'll
just
ignore
But
then
she's
never
looked
at
me
that
way
before
New
and
a
bit
alarming
Who'd
have
ever
thought
That
this
could
be
True
That
he's
no
Prince
Charming
But
there's
something
in
him
That
I
simply
didn't
see
Well
who'd
have
thought
Well
bless
my
soul
Well
who'd
have
known
Well
who
indeed
And
who'd
have
guessed
they'd
come
together
on
their
own
It's
so
peculiar
Wait
and
see
We'll
wait
and
see
A
few
days
more
There
may
be
something
there
that
wasn't
there
before
You
know
perhaps
there
is
something
there
that
wasn't
there
before
What
There
may
be
something
there
that
wasn't
there
before
What's
there
Mama
I'll
tell
you
when
you're
older
Right
then
you
all
know
why
we're
here
We
have
exactly
hours
minutes
and
seconds
to
create
the
most
magical
spontaneous
romantic
atmosphere
known
to
man
or
beast
Right
Need
I
remind
you
that
if
the
last
petal
falls
from
this
rose
the
spell
will
never
be
broken
Very
well
You
all
know
your
assignments
Half
of
you
to
the
west
wing
half
of
you
to
the
east
wing
the
rest
of
you
come
with
me
Lighten
up
Cogsworth
and
let
nature
take
its
course
It's
obvious
there's
a
spark
between
them
Yes
but
there's
no
harm
in
fanning
the
flames
you
know
a
little
Besides
they
must
fall
in
love
tonight
if
we
ever
expect
to
be
human
again
Human
again
Human
again
Yes
think
what
that
means
I'll
be
cooking
again
Be
goodlooking
again
With
a
mademoiselle
on
each
arm
When
I'm
human
again
Only
human
again
Poised
and
polished
and
gleaming
with
charm
I'll
be
courting
again
Chic
and
sporting
again
Which
should
cause
several
husbands
alarm
I'll
hop
down
off
this
shelf
and
tout
de
suite
be
myself
l
can't
wait
to
be
human
again
When
we're
human
again
Only
human
again
When
we're
knickknacks
and
whatnots
no
more
When
we're
human
again
Good
and
human
again
Oh
cheri
won't
it
all
be
topdrawer
I'll
wear
lipstick
and
rouge
And
I
won't
be
so
huge
Why
I'll
easily
fit
through
that
door
I'll
exude
savoirfaire
I'll
wear
gowns
I'll
have
hair
It's
my
prayer
to
be
human
again
When
we're
human
again
Only
human
again
When
the
world
once
more
starts
making
sense
I'll
unwind
for
a
change
Really
That
would
be
strange
Can
I
help
it
if
I'm
tense
In
a
shack
by
the
sea
I'll
sit
back
sipping
tea
Let
my
early
retirement
commence
Far
from
fools
made
of
wax
I'll
get
down
to
brass
tacks
and
relax
When
I'm
human
again
So
sweep
that
dust
from
the
floor
Let's
let
some
light
in
the
room
l
can
feel
I
can
tell
Someone
might
break
the
spell
Any
day
now
Shine
up
the
brass
on
the
door
Alert
the
dustbin
and
broom
If
it
all
goes
as
planned
Our
time
may
be
at
hand
Any
day
now
Open
the
shutters
and
let
in
some
air
Put
these
here
and
put
those
over
there
Sweep
up
the
years
of
sadness
and
tears
And
throw
them
away
We'll
be
human
again
Only
human
again
When
the
girl
finally
sets
us
all
free
Cheeks
ablooming
again
We're
assuming
again
We'll
resume
our
long
lost
joie
de
vivre
We'll
be
playing
again
Holidaying
again
And
we're
praying
it's
ASAP
We
will
push
we
will
shove
They
will
both
fall
in
love
And
we'll
finally
be
human
again
For
never
was
a
story
of
more
woe
Than
this
of
Juliet
and
her
Romeo
Could
you
read
it
again
Here
why
don't
you
read
it
to
me
All
right
I
can't
You
mean
you
never
learned
I
learned
A
little
It's
just
been
so
long
Well
here
I'll
help
you
Let's
start
here
Here
Okay
Twoh
Two
Two
I
knew
that
Two
households
We'll
be
dancing
again
We'll
be
twirling
again
We'll
be
whirling
around
with
such
ease
When
we're
human
again
Only
human
again
We'll
go
waltzing
those
old
onetwothrees
We'll
be
floating
again
We'll
be
gliding
again
Stepping
striding
as
fine
as
you
please
Like
a
real
human
does
I'll
be
all
that
I
was
On
that
glorious
morn
when
we're
finally
reborn
And
we're
all
of
us
human
Again
Tonight
is
the
night
I'm
not
sure
I
can
do
this
You
don't
have
time
to
be
timid
You
must
be
bold
daring
Bold
Daring
There
will
be
music
romantic
candlelight
provided
by
myself
And
when
the
moment
is
right
you
confess
your
love
Yes
I
I
I
No
I
can't
You
care
for
the
girl
don't
you
More
than
anything
Well
then
you
must
tell
her
Voila
You
look
so
so
Stupid
Not
quite
the
word
I
was
looking
for
Perhaps
a
little
more
off
the
top
Your
lady
awaits
Tale
as
old
as
time
True
as
it
can
be
Barely
even
friends
Then
somebody
bends
Unexpectedly
Just
a
little
change
Small
to
say
the
least
Both
a
little
scared
Neither
one
prepared
Beauty
and
the
Beast
Ever
just
the
same
Ever
a
surprise
Ever
as
before
Ever
just
as
sure
As
the
sun
will
rise
Tale
as
old
as
time
Tune
as
old
as
song
Bittersweet
and
strange
Finding
you
can
change
Learning
you
were
wrong
Certain
as
the
sun
Rising
in
the
east
Tale
as
old
as
time
Song
as
old
as
rhyme
Beauty
and
the
Beast
Tale
as
old
as
time
Song
as
old
as
rhyme
Beauty
and
the
Beast
Off
to
the
cupboard
with
you
now
Chip
It's
past
your
bedtime
Good
night
love
Belle
Are
you
happy
here
with
me
Yes
What
is
it
If
only
I
could
see
my
father
again
just
for
a
moment
I
miss
him
so
much
There
is
a
way
This
mirror
will
show
you
anything
Anything
you
wish
to
see
I'd
like
to
see
my
father
please
Papa
Oh
no
He's
sick
He
may
be
dying
and
he's
all
alone
Then
you
must
go
to
him
What
did
you
say
I
release
you
You're
no
longer
my
prisoner
You
mean
I'm
free
Yes
Thank
you
Hold
on
Papa
I'm
on
my
way
Take
it
with
you
so
you'll
always
have
a
way
to
look
back
and
remember
me
Thank
you
for
understanding
how
much
he
needs
me
Well
Your
Highness
I
must
say
everything
is
going
just
swimmingly
I
knew
you
had
it
in
you
I
let
her
go
Yes
yes
You
what
How
could
you
do
that
I
had
to
Yes
but
But
why
Because
I
love
her
He
did
what
Yes
I'm
afraid
it's
true
She's
going
away
But
he
was
so
close
After
all
this
time
he's
finally
learned
to
love
That's
it
then
That
should
break
the
spell
But
it's
not
enough
She
has
to
love
him
in
return
Now
it's
too
late
Papa
They're
back
Belle
It's
all
right
Papa
I'm
home
I
thought
I'd
never
see
you
again
I
missed
you
so
much
But
the
Beast
Did
you
How
did
you
escape
I
didn't
escape
Papa
He
He
let
me
go
That
horrible
beast
But
he's
different
now
Papa
He's
changed
somehow
Hi
A
stowaway
Why
hello
there
little
fella
Didn't
think
I'd
see
you
again
Belle
why'd
you
go
away
Don't
you
like
us
anymore
Chip
of
course
I
do
It's
just
that
May
I
help
you
I've
come
to
collect
your
father
My
father
Don't
worry
mademoiselle
We'll
take
good
care
of
him
My
father's
not
crazy
He
was
raving
like
a
lunatic
We
all
heard
him
didn't
we
Yes
No
I
won't
let
you
Belle
Maurice
tell
us
again
old
man
Just
how
big
was
the
beast
He
was
I
mean
he
was
He
was
enormous
I'd
I'd
say
at
least
eight
no
more
like
feet
Well
you
don't
get
much
crazier
than
that
It's
true
I
tell
you
Get
him
out
of
here
Let
go
of
me
No
You
can't
do
this
Poor
Belle
It's
a
shame
about
your
father
You
know
he's
not
crazy
Gaston
I
might
be
able
to
clear
up
this
little
misunderstanding
if
If
what
If
you
marry
me
What
One
little
word
Belle
That's
all
it
takes
Never
Have
it
your
way
Belle
Let
go
of
me
My
father's
not
crazy
and
I
can
prove
it
Show
me
the
Beast
Is
it
dangerous
No
no
he'd
never
hurt
anyone
Please
I
know
he
looks
vicious
but
he's
really
kind
and
gentle
He's
my
friend
If
I
didn't
know
better
I'd
think
you
had
feelings
for
this
monster
He's
no
monster
Gaston
You
are
She's
as
crazy
as
the
old
man
The
Beast
will
make
off
with
your
children
He'll
come
after
them
in
the
night
No
We're
not
safe
till
his
head
is
mounted
on
my
wall
I
say
we
kll
the
Beast
We're
not
safe
until
he's
dead
He'll
come
stalking
us
at
night
Set
to
sacrifice
our
children
To
his
monstrous
appetite
He'll
wreak
havoc
on
our
village
If
we
let
him
wander
free
So
it's
time
to
take
some
action
boys
It's
time
to
follow
me
Through
the
mist
through
the
woods
through
the
darkness
and
the
shadows
It's
a
nightmare
but
it's
one
exciting
ride
Say
a
prayer
then
we're
there
at
the
drawbridge
of
a
castle
And
there's
something
truly
terrible
inside
It's
a
beast
He's
got
fangs
razorsharp
ones
Massive
paws
kller
claws
for
the
feast
Hear
him
roar
see
him
foam
But
we're
not
coming
home
Till
he's
dead
good
and
dead
kll
the
Beast
No
I
won't
let
you
do
this
If
you're
not
with
us
you're
against
us
Bring
the
old
man
Get
your
hands
off
me
We
can't
have
them
running
off
to
warn
the
creature
Let
us
out
We'll
rid
the
village
of
this
beast
Who's
with
me
I
am
I
am
I
am
Light
your
torch
mount
your
horse
Screw
your
courage
to
the
sticking
place
We're
counting
on
Gaston
to
lead
the
way
Through
a
mist
to
a
wood
where
within
a
haunted
castle
Something's
lurking
that
you
don't
see
every
day
It's
a
beast
One
as
tall
as
a
mountain
We
won't
rest
till
he's
good
and
deceased
Sally
forth
tallyho
Grab
your
sword
and
your
bow
Praise
the
Lord
and
here
we
go
We'll
lay
siege
to
the
castle
and
bring
back
his
head
I
have
to
warn
the
Beast
This
is
all
my
fault
Papa
what
are
we
going
to
do
Now
now
We'll
think
of
something
We
don't
like
what
we
don't
understand
In
fact
it
scares
us
And
this
monster
is
mysterious
at
least
Bring
your
gns
bring
your
Knives
Save
your
children
and
your
wives
We'll
save
our
village
and
our
lives
We'll
kll
the
Beast
I
knew
it
I
knew
it
was
foolish
to
get
our
hopes
up
Maybe
it
would
have
been
better
if
she'd
never
come
at
all
Could
it
be

Ahh

Cinderella
You're
as
lovely
as
your
name
Cinderella
You're
a
sunset
in
a
frame
Though
you're
dressed
in
rags
You
wear
an
air
of
queenly
grace
Anyone
can
see
A
throne
would
be
your
proper
place
Cinderella
If
you
give
your
heart
a
chance
It
will
lead
you
To
the
kingdom
of
romance
There
you'll
see
your
dreams
unfold
Cinderella
In
the
sweetest
story
Ever
told
Once
upon
a
time
in
a
faraway
land
there
was
a
tiny
kingdom
peaceful
prosperous
and
rich
in
romance
and
tradition
Here
in
a
stately
chateau
there
lived
a
widowed
gentleman
and
his
little
daughter
Cinderella
Although
he
was
a
kind
and
devoted
father
and
gave
his
beloved
child
every
luxury
and
comfort
still
he
felt
she
needed
a
mother's
care
And
so
he
married
again
choosing
for
his
second
wife
a
woman
of
good
family
with
two
daughters
just
Cinderella's
age
by
name
Anastasia
and
Drizella
It
was
upon
the
untimely
death
of
this
good
man
however
that
the
stepmother's
true
nature
was
revealed
Cold
cruel
and
bitterly
jealous
of
Cinderella's
charm
and
beauty
she
was
grimly
determined
to
forward
the
interests
of
her
own
two
awkward
daughters
Thus
as
time
went
by
the
chateau
fell
into
disrepair
For
the
family
fortunes
were
squandered
upon
the
vain
and
selfish
stepsisters
while
Cinderella
was
abused
humiliated
and
finally
forced
to
become
a
servant
in
her
own
house
And
yet
through
it
all
Cinderella
remained
ever
gentle
and
kind
For
with
each
dawn
she
found
new
hope
that
someday
her
dreams
of
happiness
would
come
true
Well
it
serves
you
right
spoiling
people's
best
dreams
Yes
I
know
it's
a
lovely
morning
but
it
was
a
lovely
dream
too
What
kind
of
a
dream
Mmmmmm
Can't
tell
'Cause
if
you
tell
a
wish
it
won't
come
true
And
after
all
A
dream
is
a
wish
Your
heart
makes
When
you're
fast
asleep
In
dreams
you
will
lose
Your
heartaches
Shh
Whatever
you
wish
for
You
keep
Have
faith
In
your
dreams
and
someday
Your
rainbow
will
come
smiling
through
No
matter
how
your
heart
is
grieving
If
you
keep
on
believing
The
dream
that
you
wish
Will
come
true
Oh
that
clock
Old
killjoy
I
hear
you
Come
on
get
up
you
say
Time
to
start
another
day
Even
he
orders
me
around
Well
there's
one
thing
They
can't
order
me
to
stop
dreaming
And
perhaps
someday
The
dreams
that
I
wish
Will
come
true
Da

If

The
dream
that
you
wish
Will
come
true

Good

Stepmother
Pick

Yes
Stepmother
Oh

Mother
Mother
Mother
You

You

it
on
purpose
Mother
Mother
Mother
Now

Oh
She

A
big
ugly
mouse
under
my

All

Now
the
other

Come

Oh

little
Gus
Oh
Lucifer
won't
you
ever
learn
Cinderella
Yes
Stepmother
Humph
Are
you
gonna
get
it
Close
the
door
Cinderella
Come
here
You
don't
think
that
I
Hold
your
tongue
Now
it
seems
we
have
time
on
our
hands
But
I
was
only
trying
to
Silence
Time
for
vicious
practical
jokes
Perhaps
we
can
put
it
to
better
use
Now
let
me
see
There's
the
large
carpet
in
the
main
hall
Clean
it
And
the
windows
upstairs
and
down
Wash
them
Oh
yes
And
the
tapestries
and
the
draperies
But
I
just
finished
Do
them
again
And
don't
forget
the
garden
Scrub
the
terrace
Sweep
the
halls
and
the
stairs
Clean
the
chimneys
And
of
course
there's
the
mending
and
the
sewing
and
the
laundry
Oh
yes
And
one
more
thing
See
that
Lucifer
gets
his
bath
My
son
has
been
avoiding
his
responsibilities
long
enough
It's
high
time
he
married
and
settled
down
Of
course
Your
Majesty
But
we
must
be
patient
I
am
patient
But
I'm
not
getting
any
younger
you
know
I
want
to
see
my
grandchildren
before
I
go
I
understand
Sire
No
No
you
don't
know
what
it
means
to
see
your
only
child
grow
farther
farther
and
farther
away
from
you
I'm
I'm
lonely
in
this
desolate
old
palace
I
I
want
to
hear
the
pitterpatter
of
little
feet
again
Now
now
Your
Majesty
Perhaps
if
we
just
let
him
alone
Let
him
alone
With
his
silly
romantic
ideas
But
Sire
in
matters
of
love
Love
Bah
Just
a
boy
meeting
a
girl
under
the
right
conditions
So
we're
arranging
the
conditions
But
Your
Majesty
if
the
Prince
should
suspect
Suspect
Look
the
boy's
coming
home
today
isn't
he
Yes
Sire
Well
what
could
be
more
natural
than
a
ball
to
celebrate
his
return
Nothing
Sire
If
all
the
eligible
maidens
in
my
kingdom
just
happened
to
be
there
why
he's
bound
to
show
interest
in
one
of
them
isn't
he
Isn't
he
Yes
Sire
The
moment
he
does
Soft
lights
Romantic
music
All
the
trimmings
It
can't
possibly
fail
Can
it
Yes
Sire
No
Sire
Very
well
Sire
I
shall
arrange
the
ball
for
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Oh
but
Sire
Tonight
And
see
that
every
eligible
maid
is
there
Understand
Yes
Your
Majesty
The
pearshaped
toad
Ooh

You

old
thing
I'm
just
going
to
have
to
teach
you
a
lesson
Open
in
the
name
of
the
King
An
urgent
message
from
His
Imperial
Majesty
Thank
you
From
the
King
What's
it
say
Cinderelly
What's
it
say
huh
I
don't
know
He
said
it's
urgent
Ohhh
Maybe
I
should
interrupt
the
uh
music
lesson
Sing
sweet
nightingale
High
You
clumsy
You
did
it
on
purpose
It's
her
fault
Girls
girls
Remember
above
all
selfcontrol
Yes
Cinderella
I've
warned
you
never
to
interrupt
This
just
arrived
from
the
palace
From
the
palace
Give
it
here
Let
me
have
it
I'll
read
it
Well
there's
to
be
a
ball
A
ball
In
honour
of
His
Highness
the
Prince
Oh
the
Prince
And
by
royal
command
every
eligible
maiden
is
to
attend
Why
that's
us
And
I'm
so
eligible
That
means
I
can
go
too
Ha
Her
dancing
with
the
Prince
I'd
be
honoured
Your
Highness
Would
you
mind
holding
my
broom
Well
why
not
After
all
I'm
still
a
member
of
the
family
And
it
says
By
royal
command
every
eligible
maiden
is
to
attend
Yes
so
it
does
Well
I
see
no
reason
why
you
can't
go
If
you
get
all
your
work
done
Oh
I
will
I
promise
And
if
you
can
find
something
suitable
to
wear
I'm
sure
I
can
Oh

If
Isn't

my
mother's

is
oldfashioned
but
I'll
fix
that
How

begin
your
regular
chores
I
have
a
few
little
things
Very
well
I

see
why
everyone
else
has
nice
things
to
wear
and
I
always
end
up
in
these
old
rags
This
sash
I
wouldn't
be

dead
in
it
You

talk
These

You

there
will
be
other
times
Yes
Good
night
Oh
well
What's
a
royal
ball
After
all
I
suppose
it
would
be
frightfully
dull
and
boring
and
completely
Completely
wonderful
It's
my
Surprise
Surprise
Surprise
Happy

No

After

make
a
bargain
Didn't
we
Cinderella
And
I
never
go
back
on
my
word
How
very
clever
These
beads
they
give
it
just
the
right
touch
Don't
you
think
so
Drizella
No
I
don't
I
think
she's
Oh
Why

little
thief
They're
my

Hurry

yourselves
Good
night
You

lose
your
heartache
Whatever
you
wish
for
You'll
keep
Oh

isn't
true
Have
faith
in
your
dreams
and
someday
It's
just
no
use
Your
rainbow
will
come
smiling
through
No
use
at
all
No
matter
how
your
heart
is
grieving
If
you
keep
on
believing
I
can't
believe
Not
any
more
The
dream
that
you
wish
Will
come
true
There's
nothing
left
to
believe
in
Nothing
Nothing
my
dear
Oh
now
you
don't
really
mean
that
Oh
but
I
do
Nonsense
child
If
you'd
lost
all
your
faith
I
couldn't
be
here
And
here
I
am
Oh
come
now
Dry
those
tears
You
can't
go
to
the
ball
looking
like
that
The
ball
Oh
but
I'm
not
Of
course
you
are
But
we
have
to
hurry
because
even
miracles
take
a
little
time
Miracles
Mmmhmm
Watch
What
in
the
world
did
I
do
with
that
magic
wand
I
was
sure
Magic
wand
That's
strange
I
always
Then
you
must
be
Your
fairy
godmother
Of
course
Where
is
that
wand
I
Oh
I
forgot
I
put
it
away
Look
at
what
she
did
How'd
she
do
it
Now
let's
see
Hmm
I'd
say
the
first
thing
you
need
is
um
a
Pumpkin
A
Pumpkin
Mmmhmm
Now
uh
the
magic
words
Uh
Oh
Salagadoolamenchikaboola
Bibbidibobbidiboo
Put
'em
together
and
what
have
you
got
Bibbidibobbidiboo
Salagadoolamenchikaboola
Bibbidibobbidiboo
It'll
do
magic
Believe
it
or
not
Bibbidibobbidiboo
Now
salagadoola
means
Menchikaboolaroo
But
the
thingamabob
that
does
the
job
Is
bibbidibobbidiboo
Salagadoolamenchikaboola
Bibbidibobbidiboo
Put
'em
together
and
what
have
you
got
Bibbidibobbidi
Bibbidibobbidi
Bibbidibobbidiboo
Oh
looky
Isn't
it
wonderful
Oh
it's
beautiful
Yes
isn't
it
With
an
elegant
coach
like
that
of
course
we'll
simply
have
to
have
mice
Mice
Oh
this
really
is
nice
Why
we'll
have
a
coach
and
four
when
we're
through
Just
a
wave
of
my
stick
and
to
finish
the
trick
bibbidi
bobbidi
boo
Gracious
what
did
I
do
I
was
sure
there
were
four
There
should
be
one
more
There
you
are
Bibbidi
bobbidi
boo
Oh
poor
Lucifer
Serves
him
right
I'd
say
Now
um
Where
were
we
Oh
goodness
yes
You
can't
go
to
the
ball
without
um
a
horse
Another
one
But
tonight
for
a
change
you
will
handle
the
reins
and
sit
in
the
driver's
seat
too
For
instead
of
a
horse
you're
the
coachman
of
course
Bibbidi
bobbidi
boo
That
does
it
I
guess
except
for
Oh
yes
The
finishing
touch
And
that's
you
Yes
Bruno
that's
right
you'll
be
footman
tonight
Bibbidi
bobbidi
boo
Well
well
hop
in
my
dear
We
can't
waste
time
But
uh
No
don't
try
to
thank
me
Oh
I
wasn't
I
mean
I
do
but
But
don't
you
think
my
dress
Yes
it's
lovely
dear
Love
Good
heavens
child
You
can't
go
in
that
Now
let's
see
dear
Your
size
and
the
shade
of
your
eyes
Mmmhmm
Something
simple
but
daring
too
Oh
just
leave
it
to
me
What
a
gown
this
will
be
Bibbidibobbidi
Bibbidibobbidi
Bibbidibobbidiboo
Oh

a
beautiful
dress
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
beautiful
dress
And
look
glass
slippers
Why
it's
like
a
dream
A
wonderful
dream
come
true
Yes
my
child
But
like
all
dreams
well
I'm
afraid
this
can't
last
forever
You'll
have
only
till
midnight
and
then
Midnight
Thank
you
Now
now
now
just
a
minute
You
must
understand
my
dear
on
the
stroke
of
the
spell
will
be
broken
and
everything
will
be
as
it
was
before
Oh
I
understand
but
it's
more
than
I
ever
hoped
for
Bless
you
my
child
I
Goodness
me
It's
getting
late
Hurry

cooperating
Mademoiselle
Leonora
Mercedes
de
la
Tour
Daughter
of
Colonel
and
Madame
de
la
Tour
I
can't
understand
it
There
must
be
at
least
one
who'd
make
a
suitable
mother
Shh
Sire
A
suitable
wife
Mademoiselles
Drizella
and
Anastasia
Tremaine
Daughters
of
Lady
Tremaine
I

Even
I
couldn't
expect
the
boy
to
Well
if
I
may
say
so
Your
Majesty
I
did
try
to
warn
you
but
you
Sire
are
incurably
romantic
No
doubt
you
saw
the
whole
pretty
picture
in
detail
The
young
Prince
bowing
to
the
assembly
Suddenly
he
stops
He
looks
up
For
lo
there
she
stands
The
girl
of
his
dreams
Who
she
is
or
whence
she
came
he
knows
not
nor
does
he
care
for
his
heart
tells
him
that
here
here
is
the
maid
predestined
to
be
his
bride
A
pretty
plot
for
fairy
tales
Sire
But
in
real
life
oh
no
No
It
was
foredoomed
to
failure
Failure
eh
Take
a
look
at
that
you
pompous
windbag
Who
is
she
You
know
her
No
Sire
I've
never
seen
her
before
That's
one
thing
in
her
favour
The
waltz
Quick
the
waltz
Lights
The
lights
Failure
eh
Well
Now
for
a
good
night's
sleep
Oh
quite
so
Sire
I
believe
I
too
You
will
stay
right
here
See
they're
not
disturbed
and

the
boy
proposes
notify
me
immediately
Notify

Wait

is
something
familiar
about
her
Oh

love
So

what
makes
life
Divine
I'm

to
all
Heaven
Is
mine
My
heart

wings
And
I

every
star
In
the

the
miracle
That
I've
been
dreaming
of

Open

sorry
I
guess
I
forgot
about
everything
Even
the
time
but
But
it
was
so
wonderful
And
he
was
so
handsome
and
when
we
danced
Oh
I'm
sure
even
the
Prince
himself
couldn't
have
been
more
More
Oh
well
it's
over
and
Cinderelly
Look
look
The
slippers
Yeah

slipper
Your
slipper
Cinderelly
Oh
Thank
you
Thank
you
so
much
for
everything
Your
Majesty
I
see
no
point
in
beating
about
the
bush
I
regret
to
inform
you
Sire
that
the
young
lady
has
disappeared
leaving
behind
only
this
glass
slipper
Yes
I'll
do
it
No
I
just
can't
Well
come
in
Come
in
Your
Majesty
So
he's
proposed
already
Tell
me
about
it
Well
Who
is
she
I
didn't
get
a
chance
No
matter
We've
more
important
things
to
discuss
Arrangements
for
the
wedding
invitations
a
national
holiday
All
that
sort
of
thing
But
Sire
Here
Have
a
cigar
Take
a
few
more
But
Better
practise
passing
these
out
eh
But
if
you'd
only
listen
And
for
you
my
friend
Your
Majesty
please
A
knighthood
I
hereby
dub
you
Sir
Um
uh
By
the
way
what
title
would
you
like
Sire
She
got
away
Sir
She
Got
Away
A
peculiar
title
but
if
that's
what
you
She
what
Why
you
You
You
traitor
Now
Sire
Remember
your
blood
pressure
Treason
No
Sire
No
Sabotage
You
were
in
league
with
the
Prince
I
tried
to
stop
her
but
she
vanished
into
thin
air
A
likely
story
But
it's
true
Sire
All
we
could
find
was
this
glass
slipper
The
whole
thing
was
a
plot
But
Sire
he
loves
her
He
won't
rest
till
he
finds
her
He's
determined
to
marry
her
What
What
did
you
say
The
Prince
Sire
swears
he'll
marry
none
but
the
girl
who
fits
this
slipper
He
said
that
did
he
We've
got
him
But
Sire
this
slipper
may
fit
one
of
any
number
of
girls
That's
his
problem
He's
given
his
word
We'll
hold
him
to
it
No
Your
Highness
I'll
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
You'll
try
this
on
every
maid
in
my
kingdom
And
if
the
shoe
fits
bring
her
in
Yes
Your
Majesty
Cinderella
Cinderella

her
hand
in
marriage
Whereupon
should
the
aforementioned
maiden
look
with
favour
shall
the
couple
pledge
their
troth
And
in
due
course
upon
the
inevitable
demise
of
His
Majesty
the
King
succeed
to
the
throne
to
rule
over
the
land
as
King
and
Queen
of
our
kingdom

Of

Anastasia

There
I
knew
it
was
my
slipper
Exactly
my
size
I
always
wear
the
same
size
As
soon
as
I
saw
it
I
said
Oh
well
It
may
be
a
trifle
snug
today
You
know
how
it
is
dancing
all
night
I
can't
understand

Good

Good

Your

Your

May
I

Pay
no
attention
It's
Cinderella
From
the
kitchen
Ridiculous
She's
out
of
her
mind
Just
an
imaginative
child
Madam
my
orders
were
every
maiden
Come
my
child
Oh
no
No
no
no
Oh
no
Oh
this
is
terrible
The
King
what
will
he
say
What
will
he
do
Perhaps
if
it
would
help
No
no
Nothing
can
help
now
Nothing
But
you
see
I
have
the
other
slipper
Have
faith
in
dreams
And
someday
Your
rainbow
will
come
smiling
through
No
matter
how
your
heart
is
grieving
If
you
keep
on
believing
The
dream
that
you
wish
Will
come
true
Oh
l
Come
from
a
land
From
a
faraway
place
Where
the
Caravan
Camels
roam
Where
it's
flat
and
immense
And
the
heat
is
intense
It's
barbaric
but
hey
it's
home
When
the
wind's
from
the
east
And
the
sun's
from
the
west
And
the
sand
in
the
glass
is
right
Come
on
down
stop
on
by
hop
a
carpet
and
fly
To
another
Arabian
night
Arabian
nights
Like
Arabian
days
More
often
than
not
Are
hotter
than
hot
ln
a
lot
of
good
ways
Arabian
nights
'Neath
Arabian
moons
A
fool
off
his
guard
Could
fall
and
fall
hard
Out
there
on
the
dunes
Salam
and
good
evening
to
you
worthy
friend
Please
come
closer
Too
close
A
little
too
close
There
Welcome
to
Agrabah
City
of
mystery
Of
enchantment
And
the
finest
merchandise
this
side
of
the
river
Jordan
Come
on
down
Look
at
this
Combination
hookah
and
coffee
maker
Also
makes
julienne
fries
Will
not
break
Lt
broke
Look
at
this
I
have
never
seen
one
of
these
intact
before
This
is
the
famous
Dead
Sea
Tupperware
Listen
Still
good
Wait
don't
go
I
can
see
you're
only
interested
in
the
exceptionally
rare
I
think
then
you
would
be
most
rewarded
to
consider
this
Do
not
be
fooled
by
its
commonplace
appearance
Like
so
many
things
it
is
not
what
is
outside
but
what
is
inside
that
counts
This
is
no
ordinary
lamp
lt
once
changed
the
course
of
a
young
man's
life
A
young
man
who
like
this
lamp
was
more
than
what
he
seemed
A
diamond
in
the
rough
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
hear
the
tale
Lt
begins
on
a
dark
night
Where
a
dark
man
waits
with
a
dark
purpose
You
are
late
A
thousand
apologies
oh
patient
one
You
have
it
then
I
had
to
slit
a
few
throats
But
I
got
it
The
treasure
Trust
me
my
pungent
friend
You'll
get
what's
coming
to
you
Quickly
follow
the
trail
Faster
At
last
after
all
my
years
of
searching
Cave
of
Wonders
By
Allah
Now
remember
Bring
me
the
lamp
The
rest
of
the
treasure
is
yours
but
the
lamp
is
mine
The
lamp
Where
did
you
dig
this
bozo
up
Who
disturbs
my
slumber
It
is
I
Gazeem
A
humble
thief
Know
this
Only
one
may
enter
here
One
whose
worth
lies
far
within
The
diamond
in
the
rough
What
are
you
waiting
for
Go
on
Seek
thee
out
the
diamond
in
the
rough
I
can't
believe
it
I
just
don't
believe
it
We're
never
going
to
get
ahold
of
that
stupid
lamp
Look
at
this
I'm
so
ticked
off
that
I'm
molting
Patience
Iago
Patience
Gazeem
was
obviously
less
than
worthy
There's
a
big
surprise
I
think
I'm
gonna
have
a
heart
attack
and
die
from
that
surprise
What
are
we
going
to
do
We
got
a
big
problem
here
a
big
Yes
Only
one
may
enter
I
must
find
this
one
this
diamond
in
the
rough
Stop
thief
I'll
have
your
hands
for
a
trophy
street
rat
All
this
for
a
loaf
of
bread
There
he
is
You
won't
get
away
so
easily
You
think
that
was
easy
Over
that
way
And
you
follow
me
We'll
find
him
Morning
ladies
Getting
into
trouble
early
today
aren't
we
Aladdin
Trouble
No
way
You're
only
in
trouble
if
you
get
caught
Gotcha
I'm
in
trouble
Perfect
timing
Abu
As
usual
Let's
get
outta
here
Got
to
keep
one
jump
Ahead
of
the
bread
line
One
swing
ahead
of
the
sword
I
steal
only
what
I
can't
afford
That's
everything
One
jump
ahead
of
the
lawmen
That's
all
and
that's
no
joke
These
guys
don't
appreciate
I'm
broke
Riffraff
Street
rat
Scoundrel
Take
that
Just
a
little
snack
guys
Rip
him
open
take
it
back
guys
I
Can
take
a
hint
Got
to
face
the
facts
You're
my
only
friend
Abu
Who
Oh
it's
sad
Aladdin's
hit
the
bottom
He's
become
a
oneman
rise
in
crime
I'd
blame
parents
Except
he
hasn't
got
'em
Got
to
eat
to
live
got
to
steal
to
eat
Tell
you
all
about
it
when
I
got
time
One
jump
ahead
of
the
slowpokes
One
skip
ahead
of
my
doom
Next
time
going
to
use
a
nom
de
plume
There
he
is
One
jump
ahead
of
the
hit
men
One
hit
ahead
of
the
flock
I
think
I'll
take
a
stroll
Around
the
block
Stop
thief
Vandal
Abu
Scandal
Let's
not
be
too
hasty
Still
I
think
he's
rather
tasty
Got
to
eat
to
live
got
to
steal
to
eat
Otherwise
We'd
get
along
Wrong
Get
him
He's
got
a
sword
You
idiots
We've
all
got
swords
One
jump
ahead
of
the
hoof
beats
One
hop
ahead
of
the
hump
One
trick
ahead
of
disaster
They're
quick
but
I'm
much
faster
Here
goes
better
throw
my
hand
in
Wish
me
happy
landing
All
I
got
to
do
is
jump
Crazy
Hakim's
DISCOUNT
FERTILIZER
And
now
my
esteemed
Effendi
feast
away
Here
Go
on
take
it
Oh
no
On
his
way
to
the
palace
I
suppose
Another
suitor
for
the
princess
Out
of
my
way
you
filthy
brats
Hey
if
I
were
as
rich
as
you
I
could
afford
some
manners
I'll
teach
you
some
manners
Look
at
that
Abu
It's
not
every
day
you
see
a
horse
with
two
rear
ends
You
are
a
worthless
street
rat
You
were
born
a
street
rat
you'll
die
a
street
rat
and
only
your
fleas
will
mourn
you
I'm
not
worthless
And
I
don't
have
fleas
Come
on
Abu
Let's
go
home
Riffraff
street
rat
I
don't
buy
that
If
only
they'd
look
closer
Would
they
see
a
poor
boy
No
siree
They'd
find
out
There's
so
much
more
to
me
Some
day
Abu
things
are
going
to
change
We'll
be
rich
live
in
a
palace
and
never
have
any
problems
at
all
I've
never
been
so
insulted
Prince
Achmed
You're
not
leaving
so
soon
are
you
Good
luck
marrying
her
off
Jasmine
Confound
it
Rajah
So
this
is
why
Prince
Achmed
stormed
out
Oh
Father
Rajah
was
just
playing
with
him
Weren't
you
Rajah
You
were
just
playing
with
that
overdressed
selfabsorbed
Prince
Achmed
weren't
you
Dearest
you've
got
to
stop
rejecting
every
suitor
who
comes
to
call
The
law
says
you
must
be
married
to
a
prince
by
your
next
birthday
The
law
is
wrong
You've
only
got
three
more
days
Father
I
hate
being
forced
into
this
If
I
do
marry
I
want
it
to
be
for
love
Jasmine
it's
not
only
this
law
I'm
not
going
to
be
around
forever
and
I
just
want
to
make
sure
you're
taken
care
of
Provided
for
Please
try
to
understand
I've
never
done
a
thing
on
my
own
I've
never
had
any
real
friends
Except
you
Rajah
I've
never
even
been
outside
the
palace
walls
But
Jasmine
you're
a
princess
Then
maybe
I
don't
want
to
be
a
princess
anymore
Allah
forbid
you
should
have
any
daughters
I
don't
know
where
she
gets
it
from
Her
mother
wasn't
nearly
so
picky
Jafar
my
most
trusted
advisor
I
am
in
desperate
need
of
your
wisdom
My
life
is
but
to
serve
you
my
lord
It's
this
suitor
business
Jasmine
refuses
to
choose
a
husband
I'm
at
my
wits'
end
Have
a
crcker
pretty
Polly
Your
Majesty
certainly
has
a
way
with
dumb
animals
Now
then
Perhaps
I
can
divine
a
solution
to
this
thorny
problem
If
anyone
can
help
it's
you
But
it
would
require
the
use
of
the
mystic
blue
diamond
My
ring
But
it's
been
in
the
family
for
years
Lt
is
necessary
to
find
a
suitor
Don't
worry
Everything
will
be
fine
The
diamond
Here
Jafar
Whatever
you
need
will
be
fine
You
are
most
gracious
my
liege
Now
run
along
and
play
with
your
little
toys
That
will
be
pretty
good
I
can't
take
it
anymore
If
I
gotta
choke
down
on
one
more
of
those
moldy
disgusting
crackers
Calm
yourself
Iago
Soon
I
will
be
sultan
not
that
addlepated
twit
And
then
I
stuff
the
crackers
down
his
throat
I'm
sorry
Rajah
But
I
can't
stay
here
and
have
my
life
lived
for
me
I'll
miss
you
Goodbye
Jaffa
oranges
OK
Abu
go
Try
this
Your
taste
buds
will
dance
and
sing
Hey
get
your
paws
off
Get

from
here
You

dirty
ape
Byebye
Let's
go

silver
Sugar

Would
the
lady
like
a
necklace
A
pretty
necklace
for
a
pretty
lady
Fresh
fish
We
catch
'em

buy
them
No
I
don't
think
so
Excuse
me
I'm
really
very
sorry
Hello
You
must
be
hungry
Here
you
go
You'd
better
be
able
to
pay
for
that
Pay
No
one
steals
from
my
cart
I'm
sorry
sir
I
don't
have
any
money
Thief
Please
If
you
let
me
go
to
the
palace
I
can
get
some
from
the
sultan
Do
you
know
what
the
penalty
is
for
stealing
No
please
Thank
you
kind
sir
I'm
so
glad
you
found
her
I've
been
looking
for
you
What
are
you
doing
Just
play
along
You
know
this
girl
Sadly
yes
She
is
my
sister
She's
a
little
crazy
She
said
she
knew
the
sultan
She
thinks
the
monkey
is
the
sultan
O
wise
Sultan
how
may
I
serve
you
Tragic
isn't
it
But
no
harm
done
Come
along
sis
Time
to
go
see
the
doctor
Hello
doctor
How
are
you
No
not
that
one
Come
on
Sultan
What
is
it
Come
back
here
you
little
thieves
With
all
due
respect
Your
Rottenness
couldn't
we
just
wait
for
a
real
storm
Save
your
breath
Iago
Faster
Yes
oh
mighty
evil
one
Part
sands
of
time
Reveal
to
me
the
one
who
can
enter
the
cave
Yes
There
he
is
My
diamond
in
the
rough
That's
him
That's
the
clown
we've
been
waiting
for
Let's
have
the
guards
extend
him
an
invitation
to
the
palace
Shall
we
Swell
Almost
there
I
want
to
thank
you
for
stopping
that
man
Forget
it
So
this
is
your
first
time
in
the
marketplace
huh
Ls
it
that
obvious
Well
you
do
kind
of
stand
out
I
mean
you
don't
seem
to
know
how
dangerous
Agrabah
can
be
I'm
a
fast
learner
Come
on
This
way
Watch
your
head
there
Be
careful
Ls
this
where
you
live
Yep
Just
me
and
Abu
Come
and
go
as
we
please
That
sounds
fabulous
Well
it's
not
much
But
it's
got
a
great
view
The
palace
looks
pretty
amazing
huh
It's
wonderful
Wonder
what
it'd
be
like
to
live
there
And
have
servants
and
valets
Oh
sure
People
who
tell
you
where
to
go
and
how
to
dress
That's
better
than
here
Always
scraping
for
food
and
ducking
guards
You're
not
free
to
make
your
own
choices
Sometimes
you
feel
so
You're
just
trapped
So
where
are
you
from
What
does
it
matter
I
ran
away
and
I
am
not
going
back
Really
How
come
Why
you
My
father's
forcing
me
to
get
married
That's
awful
What
Abu
says
it
is
not
fair
Oh
did
he
Yeah
Of
course
And
does
Abu
have
anything
else
to
say
He
wishes
there
was
something
he
could
do
to
help
Oh
boy
Tell
him
that's
very
sweet
Here
you
are
They're
after
me
They're
after
you
My
father
must
have
sent
them
Do
you
trust
me
Yes
Then
jump
We
just
keep
running
into
each
other
don't
we
street
rat
Run
Go
get
out
of
here
It's
the
dungeon
for
you
boy
Get
off
Let
him
go
Looky
here
men
A
street
mouse
Unhand
him
By
order
of
the
princess
Princess
Jasmine
The
princess
What
are
you
doing
here
And
with
this
street
rat
That's
not
your
concern
Do
as
I
command
Release
him
I
would
Princess
Except
my
orders
come
from
Jafar
You'll
have
to
take
it
up
with
him
Believe
me
I
will
Jafar
Princess
Jafar
I'm
stuck
How
may
I
be
of
service
to
you
The
guards
took
a
boy
from
the
market
On
your
orders
Your
father
has
charged
me
with
keeping
peace
in
Agrabah
The
boy
was
a
criminal
What
was
his
crime
I
can't
breathe
Why
kidnapping
the
princess
of
course
If
you
could
just
That
hurt
He
didn't
kidnap
me
I
ran
away
Oh
dear
How
frightfully
upsetting
Had
I
but
known
What
do
you
mean
Sadly
the
boy's
sentence
has
already
been
carried
out
What
sentence
Death
By
beheading
No
I
am
exceedingly
sorry
Princess
How
could
you
So
How
did
it
go
I
think
she
took
it
rather
well
It's
all
my
fault
Raja
I
didn't
even
know
his
name
She
was
the
princess
I
can't
believe
it
I
must
have
sounded
so
stupid
to
her
Abu
down
here
Come
on
help
me
out
of
these
She
was
in
trouble
She
was
worth
it
Don't
worry
I'll
never
see
her
again
I'm
a
street
rat
remember
and
there's
a
law
She's
got
to
marry
a
prince
She
deserves
a
prince
I'm
a
fool
You're
only
a
fool
if
you
give
up
boy
Who
are
you
A
lowly
prisoner
like
yourself
But
together
perhaps
we
can
be
more
I'm
listening
There
is
a
cave
boy
A
cave
of
wonders
filled
with
treasures
beyond
your
wildest
dreams
Treasure
enough
to
impress
even
your
princess
I'd
wager
Jafar
can
you
hurry
up
I'm
dying
in
here
But
the
law
says
that
only
a
prince
Haven't
you
heard
of
the
golden
rule
Whoever
has
the
gold
makes
the
rules
So
why
would
you
share
this
treasure
with
me
I
need
a
young
pair
of
legs
and
a
strong
back
to
go
in
after
it
One
problem
It's
out
there
and
we're
in
here
Things
aren't
always
what
they
seem
So
Do
we
have
a
deal
Who
disturbs
my
slumber
It
is
I
Aladdin
Proceed
Touch
nothing
but
the
lamp
Remember
boy
First
fetch
me
the
lamp
And
then
you
shall
have
your
reward
Come
on
Abu
Would
you
look
at
that
Just
a
handful
of
this
stuff
would
make
me
richer
than
the
sultan
Don't
touch
anything
We
got
to
find
that
lamp
Will
you
knock
it
off
Are
you
crazy
A
magic
carpet
Come
on
out
We're
not
going
to
hurt
you
Take
it
easy
He's
not
going
to
bite
Thanks
Wait
a
minute
don't
go
Maybe
you
can
help
us
You
see
we're
trying
to
find
this
lamp
I
think
he
knows
where
it
is
Wait
here
This
is
it
This
is
what
we
came
all
the
way
down
here
to
No
Infidels
You
have
touched
the
forbidden
treasure
Now
you
will
never
again
see
the
light
of
day
Carpet
let's
move
This
is
no
time
to
panic
Start
panicking
Help
me
up
Throw
me
the
lamp
I
can't
hold
on
Give
me
your
hand
First
give
me
the
lamp
Yes
At
last
What
are
you
doing
Giving
you
your
reward
Your
eternal
reward
It's
mine
It's
all
mine
I
where
is
it
No
Oh
dearest
What's
wrong
Jafar
has
done
something
terrible
There
there
my
dear
We
will
set
it
right
Now
tell
me
everything
Wake
up
My
head
We're
trapped
That
twofaced
son
of
a
jackal
Well
whoever
he
was
he's
long
gone
with
that
lamp
Why
you
hairy
little
thief
Lt
looks
like
such
a
beatup
worthless
piece
of
junk
I
think
there's
something
written
here
but
it's
hard
to
make
out
Ten
thousand
years
will
give
you
such
a
crick
in
the
neck
Hang
on
a
second
Wow
does
it
feel
good
to
be
out
of
there
Nice
to
be
back
ladies
and
gentlemen
Where
are
you
from
What's
your
name
Aladdin
Nice
to
have
you
on
the
show
Can
we
call
you
Al
Or
maybe
just
Din
How
about
Laddie
Sounds
like
Here
boy
Come
on
Laddie
I
must've
hit
my
head
harder
than
I
thought
Do
you
smoke
Mind
if
I
do
Sorry
Cheetah
I
hope
I
didn't
singe
the
fur
Rugman
haven't
seen
you
in
a
few
millennia
Give
me
some
tassel
You're
smaller
than
my
last
master
Either
that
or
I'm
getting
bigger
Look
at
me
from
the
side
Do
I
look
different
to
you
Wait
a
minute
I
am
your
master
That's
right
He
can
be
taught
What
would
you
wish
of
me
The
everimpressive
the
longcontained
often
imitated
but
never
duplicated
Genie
of
the
Lamp
Right
here
direct
from
the
lamp
Right
here
for
your
very
much
wishfulfillment
Thank
you
Wishfulfillment
Three
to
be
exact
Ixnay
on
the
wishing
for
more
wishes
That's
it
Three
No
substitutions
exchanges
or
refunds
Now
I
know
I'm
dreaming
You
don't
realize
what
you
got
here
So
why
don't
you
just
ruminate
whilst
I
illuminate
the
possibilities
Well
Ali
Baba
had
them
thieves
Scheherazade
had
a
thousand
tales
But
master
you're
in
luck
'cause
up
your
sleeves
You

brand
of
magic

fails
You

some
power

your
corner

camp
You

some
punch
pizzazz
Yahoo

See

Let

Out

Abracadabra

So

Slackjawed
buggyeyed
I'm
here
to
answer
All
your
midnight
prayers
You
got
me
bona
fide
certified
You
got
a
genie
For
a
charg
d'affaires
I
got
a
powerful
urge
to
help
you
out
So
what's
your
wish
I
really
want
to
know
You
got
a
list
that's
Three
miles
long
no
doubt
Well
all
you
got
to
do
is
rub
like
so
Mr
Aladdin
sir
have
a
wish
or
two
or
three
I'm
on
the
job
you
big
nabob
You
ain't
never
had
a
friend
You
ain't
never
had
a
friend
Like
me
You
ain't
never
had
a
friend
like
me
Applause
So
what'll
it
be
Master
You're
gonna
grant
me
any
three
wishes
I
want
right
Almost
There
are
a
few
provisos
a
couple
of
quid
pro
quos
Like
Rule
one
I
can't
kll
anybody
So
don't
ask
Rule
two
I
can't
make
anybody
fall
in
love
with
anybody
else
You
little
punim
there
Rule
three
I
can't
bring
people
back
from
the
dead
It's
not
a
pretty
picture
I
don't
like
doing
it
Other
than
that
you
got
it
Provisos
You
mean
limitations
On
wishes
Some
allpowerful
genie
Can't
even
bring
people
back
from
the
dead
I
don't
know
He
probably
can't
even
get
us
out
of
this
cave
Looks
like
we'll
have
to
find
a
way
out
Excuse
me
Are
you
looking
at
me
Did
you
rub
my
lamp
Did
you
wake
me
up
Did
you
bring
me
here
And
you're
walking
out
on
me
I
don't
think
so
Not
right
now
You're
getting
your
wishes
so
sit
down
Ln
case
of
emergency
the
exits
are
here
Anywhere
Keep
your
hands
and
arms
inside
the
carpet
We're
out
of
here
Jafar
this
is
an
outrage
If
it
weren't
for
all
your
years
of
loyal
service
From
now
on
you're
to
discuss
sentencing
of
prisoners
with
me
Before
they
are
beheaded
I
assure
you
Your
Highness
it
won't
happen
again
Jasmine
Jafar
now
let's
put
this
whole
messy
business
behind
us
Please
My
most
abject
and
humblest
apologies
to
you
as
well
Princess
At
least
some
good
will
come
of
my
being
forced
to
marry
When
I
am
queen
I
will
have
the
power
to
get
rid
of
you
That's
nice
All
settled
then
Now
Jasmine
getting
back
to
this
suitor
business
If
only
I
had
gotten
that
lamp
I
will
have
the
power
to
get
rid
of
you
To
think
we
gotta
keep
kissing
up
to
that
chump
and
his
chump
daughter
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
No
Iago
Only
until
she
finds
a
chump
husband
Then
she'll
have
us
banished
Or
beheaded
Wait
a
minute
What
if
you
were
the
chump
husband
What
You
marry
the
princess
right
And
then
you
become
the
sultan
Marry
the
shrew
I
become
the
sultan
The
idea
has
merit
Yes
merit
yes
And
then
we
drop
papainlaw
and
the
little
woman
off
a
cliff
I
love
the
way
your
foul
little
mind
works
Thank
you
for
choosing
Magic
Carpet
for
all
your
travel
needs
Don't
stand
until
the
rug
has
come
to
a
complete
stop
Thank
you
Goodbye
now
Goodbye
thank
you
Well
how
about
that
Mr
Doubting
Mustafa
You
sure
showed
me
Now
about
my
three
wishes
Dost
mine
ears
deceive
me
Three
You
are
down
by
one
boy
No
I
never
actually
wished
to
get
out
of
the
cave
You
did
that
on
your
own
I
feel
sheepish
All
right
you
bad
boy
But
no
more
freebies
Fair
deal
Three
wishes
I
want
them
to
be
good
What
would
you
wish
for
Me
No
one's
asked
me
that
before
Well
in
my
case
Forget
it
What
I
can't
tell
you
Come
on
Freedom
You're
a
prisoner
It's
part
of
the
whole
genie
gig
Phenomenal
cosmic
power
Ittybitty
living
space
Genie
that's
terrible
But
oh
to
be
free
Not
to
have
to
go
What
do
you
need
To
be
my
own
master
Such
a
thing
would
be
greater
than
all
the
magic
and
treasures
in
the
world
But
what
am
I
talking
about
It's
not
going
to
happen
Wake
up
and
smell
the
hummus
Why
not
The
only
way
I
get
out
of
this
is
if
my
master
wishes
me
out
So
you
can
guess
how
often
that's
happened
I'll
do
it
I'll
set
you
free
Yeah
right
I
promise
After
my
first
two
wishes
I'll
use
my
third
wish
to
set
you
free
Well
here's
hoping
Let's
make
some
magic
So
how
about
it
What
is
it
you
want
most
Well
there's
this
girl
Wrong
I
can't
make
anybody
fall
in
love
remember
But
Genie
she's
smart
and
fun
and
Pretty
Beautiful
She's
got
these
eyes
that
just
and
this
hair
And
her
smile
But
she's
the
princess
To
even
have
a
chance
I'd
have
to
be
Can
you
make
me
a
prince
Let's
see
Chicken
la
King
No
Alaskan
king
crab
I
hate
it
when
they
do
that
Caesar
salad
Et
tu
Brute
No
To
make
a
prince
ls
that
official
Say
the
magic
words
Genie
I
wish
for
you
to
make
me
a
prince
All
right
First
that
fezandvest
combo
is
much
too
thirdcentury
These
patches
What
are
we
trying
to
say
beggar
No
Work
with
me
here
I
like
it
Now
it
still
needs
something
What
does
it
say
to
me
Lt
says
Mode
of
transportation
Excuse
me
Monkey
boy
Over
here
Here
he
comes
And
what
better
way
to
make
your
grand
entrance
than
riding
your
very
own
brandnew
camel
Watch
out
they
spit
Not
enough
Still
not
enough
What
do
you
need
Yes
Esalalumbo

Talk
about
your

Check
this
action
out
Abu
you
look
good
He's
got
the
outfit
he's
got
the
elephant
but
we're
not
through
yet
Hang
on
to
your
turban
kid
We're
going
to
make
you
a
star
Now
let's
see
Sire
I
have
found
a
solution
to
the
problem
with
your
daughter
The
problem
with
your
daughter
Really
Right
here
If
the
princess
has
not
chosen
a
husband
by
the
appointed
time
then
the
sultan
shall
choose
for
her
But
Jasmine
hated
all
those
suitors
How
could
I
choose
someone
she
hates
Not
to
worry
my
liege
There
is
more
If
in
the
event
a
suitable
prince
cannot
be
found
a
princess
must
then
be
wed
to
Interesting
What
Who
The
royal
vizier
That
would
be
me
But
I
thought
only
a
prince
can
marry
a
princess
I'm
quite
sure
Desperate
times
call
for
desperate
measures
my
lord
Desperate
measures
You
will
order
the
princess
to
marry
me
I
will
order
the
princess
to
But
you're
so
old
The
princess
will
marry
me
The
princess
will
marry
What
is
that
That
music
Jafar
you
must
come

see
this
Make

a
worldclass
menagerie
Prince

Ababwa
That
physique

Can

Weak

Well
get
on
out
in
that
square
Adjust
your
veil

prepare
To
gawk
and
grovel
And
stare

Prince
Ali
He's
got
White
Persian
monkeys
To
view
them
he
charges
no
fee
He's
got
slaves
He's
got
servants
and
flunkeys
Proud
to
work
for
him
They
bow
to
his
whim
love
serving
him
They're
just
lousy
with
loyalty
to
Ali
Prince
Ali
Prince
Ali
amorous
he
Ali
Ababwa
Heard
your
princess
was
a
sight
lovely
to

And
that

Why

A

For
Prince
Ali
Splendid
Absolutely
marvelous
Your
Majesty
I
have
journeyed
from
afar
to
seek
your
daughter's
hand
Prince
Ali
Ababwa
Of
course
I'm
delighted
to
meet
you
This
is
my
royal
vizier
Jafar
He's
delighted
too
Ecstatic
I'm
afraid
Prince
Abubu
Ababwa
Whatever
You
cannot
just
parade
in
here
uninvited
and
expect
to
By
Allah
this
is
quite
a
remarkable
device
I
don't
suppose
I
might
Why
certainly
Your
Majesty
Allow
me
Sire
I
must
advise
against
this
Oh
button
up
Jafar
Learn
to
have
a
little
fun
Just
where
did
you
say
you
were
from
Much
farther
than
you've
traveled
I'm
sure
Try
me
Duck
Polly
Watch

I'm
coming

to
land
Jafar

this
Spectacular
Your
Highness
Lt
was
lovely
Yes
I
do
seem
to
have
a
knack
for
it
This
is
a
very
impressive
youth
And
a
prince
besides
If
we're
lucky
you
won't
have
to
marry
Jasmine
after
all
I
don't
trust
him
sire
Nonsense
One
thing
I
pride
myself
on
I'm
an
excellent
judge
of
character
An
excellent
judge
yeah
sure
Naah
Jasmine
will
like
this
one
And
I'm
sure
I'll
like
Princess
Jasmine
Your
Highness
no
I
must
intercede
on
Jasmine's
behalf
This
boy
is
no
different
from
the
others
What
makes
him
think
he
is
worthy
of
the
princess
Your
Majesty
I
am
Prince
Ali
Ababwa
Just
let
her
meet
me
I
will
win
your
daughter
How
dare
you
All
of
you
Standing
around
deciding
my
future
I
am
not
a
prize
to
be
won
Oh
dear
Don't
worry
Prince
Ali
Just
give
Jasmine
time
to
cool
down
I
think
it's
time
to
say
goodbye
to
Prince
Abubu
What
am
I
going
to
do
Jasmine
won't
even
let
me
talk
to
her
I
should
have
known
I
couldn't
pull
off
this
stupid
prince
wish
So
move
That's
a
good
move
I
can't
believe
it
I'm
losing
to
a
rug
Genie
I
need
help
All
right
sparky
here's
the
deal
If
you
want
to
court
the
lady
you
got
to
be
a
straight
sht
Do
ya
got
it
What
Tell
her
the
truth
No
way
If
Jasmine
found
out
I
was
some
crummy
street
rat
she'd
laugh
at
me
A
woman
appreciates
a
man
who
can
make
her
laugh
Al
all
joking
aside
you
really
ought
to
be
yourself
That's
the
last
thing
I
want
to
be
Ok
I'm
going
to
go
see
her
I
got
to
be
smooth
cool
confident
How
do
I
look
Like
a
prince
Princess
Jasmine
Who's
there
It's
me
Prince
Ali
Prince
Ali
Ababwa
I

You

me
of
someone
I
met
in
the
marketplace
The
marketplace
I

servants
who
go
to
the
marketplace
for
me
Why
I
even
have
servants
who
go
to
the
marketplace
for
my
servants
So
it
couldn't
have
been
me
you
met
No
I
guess
not
Enough
about
you
Talk
about

She's
smart

eyes
Anything

But

bee
yourself
Yeah

What
You
are
right
You
aren't
just
some
prize
to
be
won
You
should
be
free
to
make
your
own
choice
I'll
go
No
What
How
How
are
you
doing
that
It's
a
magic
carpet
It's
lovely
You
You
don't
want
to
go
for
a
ride
do
you
We
could
get
out
of
the
palace
See
the
world
Ls
it
safe
Sure
Do
you
trust
me
What
Do

I
can
show
you
the
world

when
did
you
last
let
your
heart
decide
I
can
open
your
eyes
Take
you
wonder
by
wonder
Over
sideways
and
under
On
a
magiccarpet
ride
A
whole
new
world
A
new
fantastic
point
of
view
No
one
to
tell
us
no
or
where
to
go
Or
say
we're
only
dreaming
A
whole
new
world
A
dazzling
place
I
never
knew
But
when
I'm
way
up
here
It's
crystal
clear
That
now
I'm
in
a
whole
new
world
with
you
Now
I'm
in
a
whole
new
world
with
you
Unbelievable
sights
Indescribable
feeling
Soaring
tumbling
freewheeling
Through
an
endless
diamond
sky
A
whole
new
world
Don't
you
dare
close
your
eyes
A
hundred
thousand
things
to
see
Hold
your
breath
it
gets
better
I'm
like
a
shting
star
I've
come
so
far
I
can't
go
back
to
where
I
used
to
be
A
whole
new
world
Every
turn
a
surprise
With
new
horizons
to
pursue
Every
moment
redletter
I'll
chase
them
anywhere
There's
time
to
spare
Let
me
share
this
whole
new
world
with
you
A
whole
new
world
That's
where
we'll
be
A
thrilling
chase
A
wondrous
place
For
you
and
me
It's
all
so
magical
Yeah
It's
a
shame
Abu
had
to
miss
this
He
hates
fireworks
He
doesn't
really
like
flying
either
That
is
Oh
no
You
are
the
boy
from
the
market
I
knew
it
Why
did
you
lie
to
me
I'm
sorry
Did
you
think
I
was
stupid
That
I
wouldn't
figure
it
out
No
I
mean
I
hoped
you
wouldn't
That's
not
what
I
meant
Who
are
you
Tell
me
the
truth
The
truth
The
truth
is
I
sometimes
dress
as
a
commoner
To
escape
the
pressures
of
palace
life
But
I
really
am
a
prince
Why
didn't
you
just
tell
me
Well
you
know
Royalty
going
out
into
the
city
in
disguise
Sounds
a
little
strange
don't
you
think
Good
night
my
handsome
prince
Sleep
well
Princess
Yes
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
things
are
starting
to
go
right
Hold
him
I'm
afraid
you've
worn
out
your
welcome
Prince
Abubu
Why
you
dirty
rotten
Make
sure
he's
never
found
Never
fails
Get
in
the
bath
and
there's
a
rub
at
the
lamp
Hello
Al
Kid

out
of
it
I
can't
help
you
unless
you
make
a
wish
You
have
to
say
Genie
I
want
you
to
save
my
life
OK
Come

chosen
a
husband
for
you
What
You
will
wed
Jafar

A
fine
quality
in
a
wife

Your
Highness
Jafar's

controlling
you
with

traitor
Your
Majesty

this
can
be
explained
Guards

a
grave
for
both
of
us
Arrest
Jafar

This

Find

Search

Jasmine
are
you
all
right
Yes
Jafar
my
most
trusted
counselor
plotting
against
me
all
this
time
This
is
horrible
just
horrible
How
will
I
ever
Can
this
be
true
My
daughter
has
finally
chosen
a
suitor
Praise
Allah
You
brilliant
boy
I
could
kiss
you
I
won't
I'll
leave
that
to
my
But
you
two
will
be
wed
at
once
Yes
and
you'll
be
happy
and
prosperous
And
then
you
my
boy
will
become
sultan
Sultan
Yes
A
fine
youth
such
as
yourself
A
person
of
your
unimpeachable
moral
character
is
exactly
what
this
kingdom
needs
We
got
to
get
out
of
here
I
got
to
start
packing
Only
essentials
We
gotta
travel
light
Bring
the
gns
the
knives
And
how
about
this
picture
I
don't
know
Oh
boy
He's
cracked
He's
gone
nuts
Get
a
grip
Good
grip
Prince
Ali
is
nothing
more
than
that
urchin
Aladdin
He
has
the
lamp
Iago
Why
that
miserable
But
you
will
relieve
him
of
it
Me
Sultan
They
want
me
to
be
sultan
Hail
the
conquering
hero
You've
just
won
the
heart
of
the
princess
What
are
you
going
to
do
next
Your
line
is
I'm
going
to
free
the
genie
Any
time
Genie
I
can't
Sure
you
can
You
just
go
Genie
I
wish
you
free
I'm
serious
Look
I'm
sorry
I
really
am
But
they
want
to
make
me
sultan
No
they
want
to
make
Prince
Ali
sultan
Without
you
I'm
just
Aladdin
Al
you
won
Because
of
you
People
only
think
I'm
worth
anything
because
of
you
What
if
they
find
out
I'm
not
a
prince
What
if
Jasmine
finds
out
I'd
lose
her
I
can't
keep
this
up
on
my
own
I
can't
wish
you
free
I
understand
After
all
you've
lied
to
everyone
else
I
was
beginning
to
feel
left
out
Now
if
you'll
excuse
me
master
Genie
I'm
really
sorry
Well
fine
Then
just
stay
in
there
What
are
you
guys
looking
at
Look
I
Abu
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
Wait
Come

What
am

I
got
to
tell
Jasmine
the
truth
Ali

come

Jerk
Jafar's
going
to
be
happy
to
see
you
Excellent
work
Iago

No
really
On
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
you
are
an
eleven
Oh
Jafar
you're
too
kind
I'm
embarrassed
I'm
blushing
People
of
Agrabah
my
daughter
has
finally
chosen
a
suitor
He
is
a
man
of
integrity
Jasmine
Ali
where
you
have
you
been
There's
something
I
gotta
tell
you
The
whole
kingdom
has
turned
out
for
Father's
announcement
Jasmine
listen
to
me
Please
you
don't
understand
Good
luck
Prince
Ali
Ababwa
Look
at
them
Cheering
that
little
pipsqueak
Let
them
cheer
You
know
Al
I'm
getting
really
I
don't
think
you're
him
Tonight
the
part
of
Al
will
be
played
by
a
tall
dark
and
sinister
ugly
man
I
am
your
master
now
I
was
afraid
of
that
Genie
grant
me
my
first
wish
I
wish
to
rule
on
high
As
sultan
Bless
my
soul
What
is
this
What's
going
on
Oh
my
goodness
What's
happened
Father
Jafar
you
vile
betrayer
That's
Sultan
Vile
Betrayer
to
you
Oh

Finders
keepers
Abubu
Genie

a
new
master

Jafar
I
order
you
to
stop
But
there's
a
new
order
now
My
order
Finally
you
will
bow
to
me
We
will
never
bow
to
you
Why
am
I
not
surprised
If
you
won't
bow
before
a
sultan
then
you
will
cower
before
a
sorcerer
Genie
my
second
wish
I
wish
to
be
the
most
powerful
sorcerer
in
the
world
Genie

Ladies

I'm
dying
to
introduce
you

Get
your
hands
off

Prince
Ali

But
not
as
you

him
Read

lips
and
come
to
grips
with
reality
Yes

a
blast
from
your
past
Whose
lies
were
too
good
to
last
Say
hello
to
your
precious
Prince
Ali
Or
should
we
say
Aladdin
I
tried
to
tell
you
I'm
just
So
Ali
turns
out
to
be
merely
Aladdin
Just
a
con
need
I
go
on
Take
it
from
me
His
personality
flaws
Give
me
adequate
cause
To
send
him
packing
on
a
oneway
trip
So
his
prospects
take
a
terminal
dip
His
assets
frozen
the
venue
chosen
ls
the
ends
of
the
earth
whoopee
So
long
Goodbye
See

ExPrince
Ali
This
is

my
fault

the
chance

A

man
If

can't
do
it
Great
Jasmine

on
You
little
fool
You
thought

could
defeat
the
most
powerful
being
on
Earth
Squeeze
him
Jafar
Squeeze
him
like
a
Without
the
genie
boy
you're
nothing
The
genie
The
genie
has
more
power
than
you'll
ever
have
What
He
gave
you
your
power
He
can
take
it
away
Al
why
are
you
bringing
me
into
this
Face
it
Jafar
You're
still
just
secondbest
You're
right
His
power
does
exceed
my
own
But
not
for
long
The
boy's
crazy
He's
a
little
punchdrunk
One
too
many
hits
with
the
snake
slve
I
make
my
third
wish
I
wish
to

an
allpowerful
genie
All

Your
wish
is
my
command
Way

power
The
absolute
power
What
have
you
done
Trust
me
The
universe
is
mine
to
command
To
control
Not

fast
Jafar
Aren't
you
forgetting
something
You
wanted
to
be
a
genie
You
got
it
What
And
everything
that
goes
with
it
No
I'm
getting
out
of
here
Phenomenal
cosmic
powers
Ittybitty
living
space
Al
you
little
genius
you
Get
your
blasted
beak
out
of
my
face
Shut
up
you
moron
Don't
tell
me
to
shut
up
Allow
me
Ten
thousand
years
in
a
cave
of
wonders
ought
to
chill
him
out
Shut
up
I'm
sorry
I
lied
to
you
about
being
a
prince
I
know
why
you
did
Well
I
guess
this
is
goodbye
That
stupid
law
This
isn't
fair
I
love
you
Al
no
problem
You
still
got
one
wish
left
Say
the
word
and
you're
a
prince
again
But
what
about
your
freedom
Hey
it's
only
an
eternity
of
servitude
This
is
love
Al
you're
not
going
to
find
another
girl
like
her
in
a
million
years
Believe
me
I
know
I've
looked
Jasmine
I
do
love
you
But
I
got
to
stop
pretending
to
be
something
I'm
not
I
understand
Genie
I
wish
for
your
freedom
One
prince
pedigree
coming
up
What
Genie
you're
free
I'm
free
Quick
wish
for
something
outrageous
Say
I
want
the
Nile
Try
that
I
wish
for
the
Nile
No
way
Oh
does
that
feel
good
I'm
free
I'm
free
at
last
I'm
hitting
the
road
I'm
off
to
see
the
world
I'm
going
to
miss
you
Me
too
Al
No
matter
what
anybody
says
you'll
always
be
a
prince
to
me
That's
right
You've
certainly
proven
your
worth
as
far
as
I'm
concerned
It's
that
law
that's
the
problem
Father
Well
am
I
sultan
or
am
I
sultan
From
this
day
forth
the
princess
shall
marry
whoever
she
deems
worthy
Him
I
choose
I
choose
you
Aladdin
Call
me
Al
All
of
you

any
more
damage

I

but
I

Scuttle

Did

Scuttle
Whoa
Mermaid

Ariel
how
you
doin'
kid
Whoa
what
a
swim
Scuttle
look
what
we
found
Yeah
we
were
in
this
sunken
ship
and
it
was
really
creepy
Human
stuff
huh
Hey
let
me
see
Oh
Oh
Look
at
this
Wow
This
is
special
This
is
very
very
unusual
What
What
is
it
It's
a
dinglehopper
Humans
use
these
little
babies
to
straighten
their
hair
out
See
Just
a
little
twirl
here
and
a
yank
there
and
viola
Ya
got
an
aesthetically
pleasing
configuration
of
hair
that
humans
go
nuts
over
A
dinglehopper
What
about
that
one
Ah
This
I
haven't
seen
in
years
This
is
wonderful
A
banded
bulbous
snarfblatt
Oh
Now
the
snarfblatt
dates
back
to
prehistorical
times
when
humans
used
to
sit
around
and
stare
at
each
other
all
day
Got
very
boring
So
they
invented
this
snarfblatt
to
make
fine
music
Allow
me
Music
It's
stuck
Oh
the
concert
Oh
my
gosh
My
father's
gonna
kll
me
The
concert
was
today
Maybe
you
could
make
a
little
planter
out
of
it
or
something
I'm
sorry
I've
gotta
go
Thank
you
Scuttle
Anytime
sweetie
Anytime
Yes
hurry
home
Princess
We
wouldn't
want
to
miss
old
Daddy's
celebration
now
would
we
Ha
Celebration
indeed
Oh
bah
In
my
day
we
had
fantastical
feasts
when
I
lived
in
the
palace
And
now
look
at
me
Wasted
away
to
practically
nothing
Banished
and
exiled
and
practically
starving
while
he
and
his
flimsy
fish
folk
celebrate
Well
I'll
give
'em
something
to
celebrate
soon
enough
Flotsam
Jetsam
I
want
you
to
keep
an
extra
close
watch
on
this
pretty
little
daughter
of
his
She
may
be
the
key
to
Triton's
undoing
I
just
don't
know
what
we're
going
to
do
with
you
young
lady
Daddy
I'm
sorry
I
just
forgot
As
a
result
of
your
careless
behavior
Careless
and
reckless
behavior
The
entire
celebration
was
uh
Well
it
was
ruined
That's
all
Completely
destroyed
This
concert
was
to
be
the
pinnacle
of
my
distinguished
career
Now
thanks
to
you
I
am
the
laughing
stock
of
the
entire
kingdom
But
it
wasn't
her
fault
Uh
oh
first
uh
the
shark
chased
us
Yeah
yeah
And
we
tried
to
but
we
couldn't
and
he
And
And
we
Whoa
And
then
we
were
safe
But
then
this
seagull
came
and
it
was
This
is
this
and
that
is
that
And
Seagull
What
Oh
You
went
up
to
the
surface
again
didn't
you
Didn't
you
Nothing
happened
Oh
Ariel
how
many
times
must
we
go
through
this
You
could
have
been
seen
by
one
of
those
barbarians
byby
one
of
those
humans
Daddy
they're
not
barbarians
They
are
dangerous
Do
you
think
I
want
to
see
my
youngest
daughter
snared
by
some
fisheater's
hook
I'm
years
old
I'm
not
a
child
anymore
Don't
you
take
that
tone
of
voice
with
me
young
lady
As
long
as
you
live
under
my
ocean
you'll
obey
my
rules
But
if
you
would
just
listen
Not
another
word
And
I
am
never
never
to
hear
of
you
going
to
the
surface
again
Is
that
clear
Hmph
Teenagers
They
think
they
know
everything
You
give
them
an
inch
they
swim
all
over
you
Do
you
think
I
was
too
hard
on
her
Definitely
not
Why
if
Ariel
was
my
daughter
I'd
show
her
who
was
boss
None
of
this
flitting
to
the
surface
and
other
such
nonsense
No
sir
I'd
keep
her
under
tight
control
You're
absolutely
right
Sebastian
Of
course
Ariel
needs
constant
supervision
Constant
Someone
to
watch
over
her
to
keep
her
out
of
trouble
All
the
time
And
you
are
just
the
crab
to
do
it
How
do
I
get
myself
into
these
situations
I
should
be
writing
symphonies
not
tagging
along
after
some
headstrong
teenager
Hmm
What
is
that
girl
up
to
Huh
Ariel
are
you
okay
If
only
I
could
make
him
understand
I
just
don't
see
things
the
way
he
does
I
don't
see
how
a
world
that
makes
such
wonderful
things
could
be
bad
Look
at
this
stuff
Isn't
it
neat
Wouldn't
you
think
my
collection's
complete
Wouldn't
you
think
I'm
the
girI
The
girl
who
has
everything
Look
at
this
trove
Treasures
untoId
How
many
wonders
can
one
cavern
hold
Lookin'

Up

Wanderin'

What
wouId
I
give
if
I

Out

these
waters
What
would
I
pay
to
spend
a
day
Warm

sand
Bet

Bet

don't
reprimand
their
daughters
Bright
young
women
sick
of
swimmin'
Ready

And
ready
to
know
what
the
people

Ask

What's

Burn
When's

Wouldn't

A

Her

lake
You

nail
that
girl's
fins
to
the
floor
Sebastian
Sebastian
I've
been
looking
all
over
for
you
I've
got
an
urgent
message
from
the
sea
king
The
sea
king
He
wants
to
see
you
right
away
Something
about
Ariel
He
knows
Hey
let's
see
now
Oh
who
could
the
lucky
merman
be
Come
in
Sebastian
I
mustn't
overreact
I
must
remain
calm
Yes
Yes
Your
Majesty
Yes
Sebastian
I'm
concerned
about
Ariel
Have
you
noticed
she's
been
acting
peculiar
lately
Oh
Uh
peculiar
You
know
mooning
about
Daydreaming
singing
to
herself
You
haven't
noticed
hmm
Oh
well
I
Sebastian
Hmm
I
know
you've
been
keeping
something
from
me
Keeping
something
About
Ariel
Ariel
In
love
hmm
I
tried
to
stop
her
sir
She
wouldn't
listen
I
told
her
to
stay
away
from
humans
They
are
bad
They
are
trouble
Humans
What
about
humans
Humans
Who
said
anything
about
humans
Flounder
why
can't
you
just
tell
me
what
this
is
all
about
You'll
see
It's
a
surprise
Oh
Flounder
Flounder
you're
the
best
It
looks
just
like
him
It
even
has
his
eyes
Why
Eric
run
away
with
you
Oh
this
is
all
so
so
sudden
Daddy
I
consider
myself
a
reasonable
merman
I
set
certain
rules
and
I
expect
those
rules
to
be
obeyed
But
Dad
I
Is
it
true
you
rescued
a
human
from
drowning
Daddy
I
had
to
Contact
between
the
human
world
and
the
mer
world
is
strictly
forbidden
Ariel
you
know
that
Everyone
knows
that
He
would
have
died
One
less
human
to
worry
about
You
don't
even
know
him
Know
him
I
don't
have
to
know
him
They're
all
the
same
Spineless
savage
harpooning
fisheaters
incapable
of
any
feeling
Daddy
I
love
him
No
Have
you
lost
your
senses
completely
He's
a
human
You're
a
mermaid
I
don't
care
So
help
me
Ariel
I
am
going
to
get
through
to
you
And
if
this
is
the
only
way
so
be
it
Daddy
No
No
Please
Daddy
stop
Daddy
stop
it
Daddy
no
Ariel
I
Just
go
away
Poor
child
Poor
sweet
child
She
has
a
very
serious
problem
If
only
there
were
something
we
could
do
But
there
is
something
Who
Who
are
you
Don't
be
scared
We
represent
someone
who
can
help
you
Someone
who
can
make
all
your
dreams
come
true
Just
imagine
You
and
your
prince
Together
forever
I
don't
understand
Ursula
has
great
powers
The
sea
witch
Why
that's
I
couldn't
possibly
No
Get
out
of
here
Leave
me
alone
Suit
yourself
That
was
only
a
suggestion
Wait
Yes
Poor
Ariel
I
didn't
mean
to
tell
It
was
an
accident
Ariel
Where
are
you
going
Ariel
what
are
you
doing
here
with
this
riffraff
I'm
going
to
see
Ursula
Ariel
no
No
She's
a
demon
She's
a
monster
Why
don't
you
go
tell
my
father
You're
good
at
that
But
But
I
Come
on
This
way
Come
in
Come
in
my
child
We
mustn't
lurk
in
doorways
It's
rude
One
might
question
your
upbringing
Now
then
you're
here
because
you
have
a
thing
for
this
human
this
uh
prince
fellow
Not
that
I
blame
you
He
is
quite
a
catch
isn't
he
Well
angelfish
the
solution
to
your
problem
is
simple
The
only
way
to
get
what
you
want
is
to
become
a
human
yourself
Can
you
do
that
My
dear
sweet
child
That's
what
I
do
It's
what
I
live
for
to
help
unfortunate
merfolk
like
yourself
poor
souls
with
no
one
else
to
turn
to
I
admit
that
in
the
past
I've
been
a
nasty
They
weren't
kidding
when
they
called
me
well
a
witch
But
you'll
find
that
nowadays
I've
mended
all
my
ways
Repented
seen
the
light
and
made
a
switch
True
Yes
And
I
fortunately
know
a
little
magic
It's
a
talent
that
I
aIways
have
possessed
And
here
lateIy
please
don't
laugh
I
use
it
on
behalf
Of
the
miserable
lonely
and
depressed
Pathetic
Poor
unfortunate
souls
In
pain
in
need
This
one
longing
to
be
thinner
That
one
wants
to
get
the
girl
And
do
I
help
them
Yes
indeed
Those
poor
unfortunate
souls
So
sad
so
true
They
come
flocking
to
my
cauldron
crying
Spells
Ursula
please
And
I
help
them
Yes
I
do
Now
it's
happened
once
or
twice
Someone
couldn't
pay
the
price
And
I'm
afraid
I
had
to
rake
'em
across
the
coals
Yes
I've
had
the
odd
complaint
But
on
the
whole
I've
been
a
saint
To
those
poor
unfortunate
souls
Now
here's
the
deal
I
will
make
you
a
potion
that
will
turn
you
into
a
human
for
three
days
Got
that
Three
days
Now
listen
this
is
important
Before
the
sun
sets
on
the
third
day
you've
got
to
get
dear
old
princie
to
fall
in
love
with
you
That
is
he's
got
to
kiss
you
Not
just
any
kiss
the
kiss
of
true
love
If
he
does
kiss
you
before
the
sun
sets
on
the
third
day
you'll
remain
human
permanently
But
if
he
doesn't
you'll
turn
back
into
a
mermaid
and
you
belong
to
me
No
Ariel
Have
we
got
a
deal
If
I
become
human
I'll
never
be
with
my
father
or
sisters
again
That's
right
But
you'll
have
your
man
Life's
full
of
tough
choices
isn't
it
Oh
And
there
is
one
more
thing
We
haven't
discussed
the
subject
of
payment
You
can't
get
something
for
nothing
you
know
But
I
don't
have
any
I'm
not
asking
much
Just
a
token
really
a
trifle
You'll
never
even
miss
it
What
I
want
from
you
is
your
voice
My
voice
You've
got
it
sweetcakes
No
more
talking
singing
Zip
But
without
my
voice
how
can
I
You'll
have
your
looks
your
pretty
face
And
don't
underestimate
the
importance
of
body
language
Ha
The
men
up
there
don't
like
a
lot
of
blabber
They
think
a
girl
who
gossips
is
a
bore
Yes
on
land
it's
much
preferred
for
ladies
not
to
say
a
word
And
after
all
dear
what
is
idle
prattle
for
Come
on
then
They're
not
all
that
impressed
with
conversation
True
gentlemen
avoid
it
when
they
can
But
they
dote
and
swoon
and
fawn
on
a
lady
who's
with
drawn
It's
she
who
holds
her
tongue
who
gets
her
man
Come
on
you
poor
unfortunate
soul
Go
ahead
Make
your
choice
I'm
a
very
busy
woman
and
I
haven't
got
all
day
It
won't
cost
much
just
your
voice
Ya
poor
unfortunate
soul
It's
sad
but
true
If
you
want
to
cross
a
bridge
my
sweet
you've
got
to
pay
the
toll
Take
a
gulp
and
take
a
breath
and
go
ahead
and
sign
the
scroll
Flotsam
Jetsam
Now
I've
got
her
boys
The
boss
is
on
a
roll
This
poor
unfortunate
Soul
Beluga
sevruga
Come
winds
of
the
Caspian
Sea
Larynxis
glossitis
Et
maxlaryngitis
La
voce
to
me
Now

Keep

That
voice
I
can't
get
it

of
my
head
I've

speciality
stuffed
crab
Maurice
Chevalier
How
I

les
poissons
Love
to
chop
and
to
serve
little
fish
First
I
cut
off
their
heads
Then
I
pull
out
their
bones
With
the
cleaver
I
hack
them
in
two
I
pull
out
what's
inside
and
I
serve
it
up
fried
God
I
love
little
fishes
Don't
you
Here's
something
for
tempting
the
palate
Prepared
in
the
classic
technique
First
you
pound
the
fish
flat
with
the
mallet
Then
you
slash
through
the
skin
Give
the
belly
a
slice
Then
you
rub
some
salt
in
'cause
that
makes
it
taste
nice
Oh
Zut

Sacre

silver
pot

King

Triton
She's

We

a
deal
Daddy
I'm
sorry
II
I
didn't
mean
to
I
didn't
know
You
see
The
contract's
legal
binding
and
completely
unbreakable
even
for
you
Of
course
I
always
was
a
girl
with
an
eye
for
a
bargain
The
daughter
of
the
great
sea
king
is
a
very
precious
commodity
But
I
might
be
willing
to
make
an
exchange
for
someone
even
better
Eric
what
are
you
doing
Grim
I
lost
her
once
I'm
not
gonna
lose
her
again
Now
do
we
have
a
deal
Ha
It's
done
then
No
Oh
no
Your
Majesty
Daddy
At
last
it's
mine
No
You
You
monster
Don't
fool
with
me
ya
little
brat
Contract
or
no
I'll
blast
Ow
Why
you
little
fool
Eric
Eric
look
out
After
him
Come
on
Ow
Say
goodbye
to
your
sweetheart
Aah
Babies
My
poor
little
poopsies
Eric
you've
gotta
get
away
from
here
No
I
won't
leave
you
You
pitiful
insignificant
fools
Look
out
Now
I
am
the
ruler
of
all
the
ocean
The
waves
obey
my
every
whim
Eric
The
sea
and
all
its
spoils
bow
to
my
power
Eric
So
much
for
true
love
She
really
does
love
him
doesn't
she
Sebastian
Well
it's
like
I
always
say
Your
Majesty
Children
got
to
be
free
to
lead
their
own
lives
You
always
say
that
Then
I
guess
there's
just
one
problem
left
And
what's
that
Your
Majesty
How
much
I'm
going
to
miss
her
Aha
Yes
Thank
you
Thank
you
I
love
you
Daddy
Now
we
can
waIk
Now
we
can
run
Now
we
can
stay
all
day
in
the
sun
Just
you
and
me
And
I
can
be
Part
of
your
world
EUGENE
This
is
the
story
of
how
I
died
and
went
to
Heaven
LAUGHS
Okay
so
the
Kingdom
of
Corona
to
be
exact
but
hey
let's
not
get
hung
up
on
semantics
Once
upon
a
time
a
single
drop
of
sunlight
fell
from
the
heavens
You
know
what
I'm
just
gonna
give
you
the
rapidfire
shorthand
here
The
sun
drop
created
a
golden
flower
with
healing
powers
Creepy
old
Mother
Gothel
sang
a
song
to
said
flower
to
regain
her
youth
Yada
yada
The
queen
got
sick
Flower
healed
Queen
Queen
gave
birth
to
Rapunzel
who
was
born
with
the
flower's
healing
powers
and
everything
was
all
flying
lanterns
and
cheering
subjects
Until
Gothel
stole
the
princess
and
kept
her
locked
in
a
tower
for
long
years
Then
the
princess
was
rescued
by
a
dashing
steelyeyed
suave
smoldering
devilishly
charming
rogue
Now
some
people
might've
called
him
a
thief
but
I
always
prefer
the
term
misunderstood
good
guy
You
see
it
wasn't
always
easy
for
young
Eugene
raised
as
an
orphan
on
the
rough
streets
RAPUNZEL
Hey
Eugene
focus
EUGENE
Huh
Oh
Right
Sorry
So
the
beautiful
young
maiden
that's
you
and
the
handsome
rogue
that's
me
made
a
deal
We
followed
some
lanterns
I
saved
you
from
Gothel
You
saved
me
from
death
Then
you
got
arguably
the
world's
most
overlydramatic
haircut
And
then
RAPUNZEL
And
then
I
was
reunited
with
my
longlost
family
But
that
is
where
our
new
story
began
Six
months
had
past
I
was
loving
life
inside
the
Kingdom
of
Corona
And
my
coronation
to
officially
become
princess
had
finally
come
We
all
had
a
few
surprises
that
day
didn't
we
sunshine
LAUGHING
EUGENE
Laugh
it
up
frog
Now
I
know
what
you're
all
thinking
Yes
Eugene
and
I
did
get
married
But
make
no
mistake
getting
to
the
wedding
day
and
our
happily
ever
after
would
be
the
biggest
adventure
we
would
ever
face
Oh
that's
good
GALLOPING
They're
gaining
on
us
There's
more
of
them
It'll
keep
things
interesting
Man
these
guys
are
persistent
So
am
I
I'll
meet
you
at
the
wall
Sounds
like
a
challenge
Think
you
can
keep
up
Oh
it's
not
me
you
have
to
worry
about
EUGENE
ECHOING
They're
your
problem
now
Oh

Okay
okay
I
know
what
you're

Now
it
may
have
seemed
like
you
won
but
you
gotta
take
into
account
that
my
hair
is
longer
than
yours
now
So
we
gotta
factor
in
wind
resistance
SIGHS
Wow
Have
you
ever
seen
anything
so
beautiful
Yes
Yes
I
have
GUARD
Game's
over
Your
Highness
The
welcoming
ceremony
is
about
to
begin
Well
I
think
we
showed
those
guards
who's

Now
what
do
you
say
we
go
make
you
an
official
princess
Oh
is
that
today
LAUGHS
Very

Now
come

HORSE
WHINNIES
GUARD
GROANS
This
is
life
after
happily
ever
after
And
it's
all
just
as
sweet
as
the
stories
say
I
feel
wild
free
as
light
as
can
be
And
ready
to
explore
With
nothing
at
all
standing
in
my
way
True
there
are
certain
customs
I
have
to
follow
Curtsy
Several
small
obligations
I
can't
avoid
Princess
the
time
A
few
rules
too
Well
more
than
a
few
Commitments
by
the
score
Aside
from
all
that
though
I'm
overjoyed
This
way
Princess
And
sure
there
are
corsets
and
buckles
and
bows
Plus
all
those
names
to
recall
Jane
Right
Ethel
Still
I
can
hardly
complain
I
suppose
This
is
happily
ever
after
after
all
That's
enough
I'll
take
it
from
here
How
you
holding
up
Busy
LAUGHS
But
busy's
good
I'm
glad
you
think
so
This
welcoming
ceremony
is
just
the
beginning
Tomorrow's
the
festival
followed
by
the
royal
banquet
That's
all
before
the
actual
coronation
on
Sunday
Oh
come
on
Really
Look
Rapunzel
I
know
this
princess
thing
is
new
to
you
but
you've
gotta
at
least
try
to
act
the
part
Trust
me
Cassandra
I
know
how
important
this
is
to
my
dad
As
you've
requested
Your
Majesty
we've
doubled
security
on
the
on
the
main
gates
and
the
south
towers
Good
We
have
guests
from
all
over
the
world
I
want
them
to
know
that
they
are
safe
Everything
for
my
little
girl's
coronation
weekend
must
be
absolutely
perfect
Hi
Dad
And
now
that
at
last
you
are
here
in
my
arms
I
won't
permit
you
to
fall
I
must
protect
you
from
all
the
world's
harms
We'll
live
happily
ever
after
after
all
Now
as
princess
you
are
not
only
representing
yourself
and
the
family
but
all
of
Corona
Don't
worry
Dad
I
won't
let
you
down
But
while
we're
on
the
whole
princess
coronation
thingy
I
mean
all
these
royal
activities
are
great
but
do
you
think
I
might
be
able
to
catch
a
little
down
time
soon
I
know
this
is
all
new
but
you'll
adjust
After
all
your
friend
seems
to
be
getting
on
just
fine
LAUGHS
Helmut
my
man
this
hat
ties
the
whole
outfit
together
Now
I
know
what
you're
all
thinking
Why
is
Eugene
in
such
a
good
mood
today
I
mean
what
gives
Now
that
we're
livin'
splendidly
Our
dreams
fulfilled
extendedly
Why
leave
things
openendedly
for
Rapunzel
and
moi
Tonight
I'll
hand
this
rose
to
her
Kneel
down
and
then
propose
to
her
And
give
this
ring
I
chose
to
her
Nice
Life's
gonna
be
like
strawberry
sherbet
Once
she
is
Mrs
Eugene
Fitzherbert
Okay
not
great
but
how
'bout
this
Once
she
is
Princess
Eugene
Fitzherbert
And
what
better
day
to
propose
to
a
princess
than
at
her
coronation
BOTH
SINGING
This
is

And
our
story
has
finally
reached
its
end
Settling
down

Year
upon

Contented
and
secure
With
dozens
of
duties
we'll
have
to
tend
BOTH
SINGING
And
now
that
we've
gotten
the
dream
that
we
chose
Now
that
we're
in
for
the
haul
Now
our
adventures
can
come
to
a
close
Living
happily
ever
after
after
all
RAPUNZEL
SINGING
Now
that
I've
gotten
the
dream
that
I
chose
Why
does
my
world
feel
so
small
If
this
is
it
and
it
is
I
suppose
Is
this
happily
ever
after
after
all
Okay
no
pressure
Just
introducing
myself
to
the
most
important
people
in
the
world
Representing

I've
been

upset
sweetheart
I
said
you
could
do
whatever
you
wanted
That's
what
you
did
CHUCKLES
INHALES
DEEPLY
You
didn't
say
anything
about
a
battalion
tagging
along
Why
would
I
need
to
You're
royalty
making
a
public
appearance
But
Dad
EUGENE
CLEARING
THROAT
Ladies
and
gentlemen
dukes
and
duchesses
barons
and
baronesses
marquis
and
you
know
the
female
version
of
those
may
I
share
a
moment
of
history
with
you
Princess
would
you
join
me
up
here
Tonight
we
celebrate
our
love
for
the
princess
I
can
think
of
no
better
way
to
celebrate
the
love
I
have
for
this
woman
than
this
SQUEAKS
Oh
Eugene
Wait
did
you
drop
something
No
Rapunzel
from
the
moment
I
first
met
you
and
you
knocked
me
out
with
that
frying
pan
I
knew
it
was
love
You're
my
light
You're
my
best
friend
and
I
want
to
be
your
partner
in
all
things
I
can't
wait
to
laugh
with
you
and
share
with
you
EUGENE
I
see
us
raising
our
children
here
And
our
children's
children
And
celebrating
banquets
of
our
own
in
this
very
hall
for
many
many
many
many
years
to
come
I
want
to
ride
our
horses
to
the
Corona
wall
together
each
and
every
morning
until
we're
both
very
very
old
and
grey
I
love
you
Rapunzel
And
I
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
here
together
Here
in
this
castle
SIGHS
forever
I
mean
unless
you
want
to
rent
but
I
hardly
see
how
we'll
top
this
EUGENE
I
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
with
you
here
It
doesn't
get
any
better
than
this
this
castle
FREDERIC
Princesses
need
to
be
protected
at
all
times
Rapunzel
Rapunzel
SIGHS
I
Wow
INHALES
DEEPLY
I
love
you
Eugene
but
I
can't
Just

now
Um
SIGHS
I
need
some
air
CROWD
CHATTERING
Oh
I
feel
horrible
about
Eugene
INHALES
I
do
love
him
and
I
want
to
marry
him
someday
But
not
like
this
GROANS
I
need
to
get
out
and
clear
my
head
without
a
fleet
of
guards
tailing
me
Say
no
more
GASPS
Whoa
RAPUNZEL
Where's
the
wr
Well
when
your
dad
is
Captain
of
the
Guards
you
tend
to
collect
stuff
THUDS
I
have
a
feeling
this
is
gonna
be
fun
Pascal
I
need
you
to
stay
here
and
make
sure
no
one
knows
I'm
gone
SQUEALS
The
princess's
ladyinwaiting
made
it
expressly
clear
Ladyinwait
What
You
you
mean
Cassandra
First
off
calling
Cassandra
a
lady
anything
is
being
incredibly
generous
Secondly
come
on
Stan
It's
me
your
buddy
Eugene
Eugene
the
fiend
You
know
Rapunzel
would
want
to
talk
to
me
if
you
let
me
in
Sorry
Eugene
orders
are
orders
All
right
Just
doing
your
job
I
respect
that
You
sure
there's
no
way
to
let
me
in
Rapunzel
SQUEALING
Rapunzel
There
you
are
Um
look
Rapunzel
I
am
sorry
I
am
so
sorry
I
should
never
have
put
you
on
the
spot
like
that
But
I
want
you
to
know
I
meant
it
I
want
to
marry
you
I
love
you
It's
okay
You're
still
upset
I
understand
You're
not
ready
to
say
it
back
yet
Totally
cool
Oh
man
that
is
a
good
pillow
What
is
that
Goose
down
Some
kind
of
down
Horsehair
Alpaca
SQUEALING
Sorry
Look
I
know
there's
still
a
ton
of
details
we
need
to
figure
out
And
I
may
have
jumped
the
gn
a
little
It's
just
that
growing
up
poor
and
alone
I
got
used
to
having
nothing
But
now
with
you
I
finally
have
something
You
know
we
have
something
Something
that
is
amazing
and
I
guess
tonight
I
was
just
trying
to
keep
it
that
way
And
I
thought
that's
what
you
wanted
too
but
I
guess
I
was
wrong
GROANS
SQUEALS
Oh
come
on
say
something
SQUEAKING
SCREAMS
CHUCKLES
Fantastic
I
just
poured
my
heart
out
to
a
frog
Okay
where'd
she
go
SQUEALS
Pascal
You
realize
that
if
the
king
finds
out
she's
gone
we're
all
going
to
be
in
trouble
right
I'm
aware
it's
not
protocol
Pete
I
just
happen
to
think
it
highlights
my
mustache
Hey
Stan
great
look
I
mean
it
really
brings
out
the
'stache
All
right
you
got
us
all
down
here
What's
this
plan
of
yours
Oh
it's
not
my
plan
boys
It's
Lady
Caine's
plan
CHATTERING
Who'd
he
say
Lady
Caine
See
years
ago
the
princess
was
taken
from
Corona
And
it
was
because
of
her
the
king
unfairly
cracked
down
on
all
those
he
considered
undesirable
Us
Yeah
So
Gentlemen
Lady
Caine
is
promising
not
only
to
make
you
all
rich
but
is
offering
you
the
opportunity
to
exact
revenge
on
the
king
and
his
precious
little
princess
So
who's
in
GASPS
Is
that
a
secret
passage
It
was
before
you
announced
it
to
the
whole
cast
Rapunzel
Rapunzel
Rapunzel
are
you
in
there
CLEARING
THROAT
Is
who
in
there
Eugene
Huh
Uh
No
one
This
is
just
a
part
of
my
nightly
routine
You
know
checking
the
castle
for
intruders
Keeping
an
eye
on
Rapunzel
like
I
promised
FREDERIC
Mmhmm
Hey
anyone
in
there
No
Good
See
The
system
works
really
well
I
think
Eugene
where
is
Rapunzel
Uh
uh
In
her
room
of
course
Good
I'd
like
to
speak
with
her
You
can't
I
mean
you
can
obviously
You
can
do
whatever
you
want
You're
the
king
A
very
large
intimidating
beardy
CLEARS
THROAT
yet
clearly
understanding
king
It's
just
she
she's
still
upset
And
she
said
she
needed
time
alone
I
was
only
trying
to
respect
that
But
like
I
said
you
are
the
king
The
very
sweet
and
nonhostile
king
Well
maybe
she
does
need
some
time
to
herself
But
when
you
see
her
please
tell
her
that
I'm
looking
for
her
SIGHS
Sir
uh
about
the
whole
proposal
earlier
That
didn't
go
quite
as
I
had
hoped
We'll
discuss
that
later
son
Much
later
Right
We
both
have
bigger
fish
to
fry
That
was
so
fun
I'd
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
remind
you
that
we're
supposed
to
be
sneaking
out
Cass
I
think
you'll
discover
that
I
can
be
sneaky
when
I
need
to
Nightly
patrols
We
can
get
by
them
if
we
time
it
right
Wait
How
did
you
know
they
were
coming
I
have
eyes
in
the
sky
That
is
amazing
You
have
your
own
owl
What's
his
name
Owl
Max
Yeah
When
he
heard
I
was
sneaking
you
out
he
insisted
he
come
along
SNORTS
And
between
you
and
me
I
think
he's
got
something
for
you
know
who
SNORTS
RAPUNZEL
Hmm
It'll
be
our
secret
NEIGHS

yourself

hopin'
Dreamin'
of

I've
never
tried
Tangled
in

just
waitin'
for
my
time
to
shine
What
if
the
doors
began
to
open
What
if
the
knots
became
untied
What
if
one
day
nothing
stood
in
my
way
And
the
world
was
mine
Would
it
feel
this
fine
'Cause
I've
got
the
wind
in
my
hair
And
a
gleam
in
my
eyes
And
an
endless
horizon
I've
got
a
smile
on
my
face
And
I'm
walkin'

And
everything

all
gonna
happen
to
me
out

I'll

With

So
many
roads
I've
yet
to
travel
So
many
friends
I
haven't
met
So
many
new

Just
around
the

Plenty
of
mysteries
to
unravel
Tons
of
mistakes
to
not
regret
So
much
to
see
and
to
do
and
to
be
A
whole
life
to
spend
And
it
doesn't
end
'Cause
I've
got
the
wind
in
my
hair
and
a
song
in
my
heart
And
the
fun's
only
starting
I
got
a
skip
in
my
step
And
I
haven't
a
care
And
everything
life
ought
to
be
Well
I
know
that
it's
waiting
for
me
out
there
And
I'll
find
it
I
swear
With
the
wind
in
my
hair
Just
remember
no
one
can
ever
know
I
took
you
outside

You

Why
He
can't

anything
about
last

I
told
you
Rapunzel
If
it
gets
out
I
took
you
outside
Corona
I'm
done
for
But
I
trust
Eugene
Well
I
don't
My

will
have

taken

We'll
never

EUGENE
Oh

Okay

this

No
not
new
right
We've
seen
this
That
magic
thing
is
involved
again
It
was
magic
right
Don't
tell
me
I'll
just
say
your
hair
magically
grew
back
I'm
not
gonna
ask
how
Obviously
you
don't
want
to
tell
me
or
else
you
wouldn't
have
tried
to
hide
it
from
me
I
won't
ask
how
it
grew
back
but
how
did
it
grow
back
Don't
answer
that
The
important
thing
is
you're
okay
You
are
okay
right
I
don't
care
what
happened
I
mean
I
care
but
I'm
sure
there's
a
reasonable
explanation
Where
is
the
wr
that
you'll
share
when
you're
ready
Thank
you
for
understanding
Oh
come
on
Really
I
thought
we
trusted
each
other
Rapunzel
We
do
I
do
It's
just
Fine
You
know
what
I
can't
make
you
tell
me
what
happened
but
obviously
you're
keeping
something
from
me
But
whatever
it
is
I
just
want
you
to
know
you
should
never
feel
like
you
have
to
hide
anything
from
me
SNORTS
SQUEALS
You
don't
hide
things
from
the
people
you
love

ARIANNA

Hide

You
gotta
hide
your
hair
Rapunzel
SCREAMS
May
I
come
in
sweetheart
SQUEALING
You
can't
I'm
brushing
my
teeth
ARIANNA
Oh
good
But
I
can
still
come
in
can't
I
Believe
me
Mom
You
do
not
want
to
Morning
breath
Wouldn't
want
to
expose
you
to
that
That's
very
thoughtful
of
you
Um
Dad
and
I
want
you
to
join
us
on
the
terrace
for
breakfast
RAPUNZEL
Um
I
don't
know
There's
a
lot
of
stuff
I
have
to
do
to
get
ready
ARIANNA
Rapunzel
well
your
father
has
something
very
important
to
share
with
you
He's
been
waiting
all
night
Yeah
Sure
I
will
meet
you
there
in
a
minute
The
coronation
is
in
two
hours
How
am
I
supposed
to
cut
this
hair
SQUEAKS
I
might
have
an
idea
So
uh
Rapunzel
ready
for
the
big
day
You
bet
Already
into
the
princess
spirit
The
bigger
the
wig
the
better
the
princess
right
So
Dad
Mom
said
you
wanted
to
talk
Yes
Rapunzel
last
night
your
mother
and
I
had
a
discussion
SIGHS
I
know
that
I'm
not
always
able
to
separate
the
man
from
the
king
and
separating
the
father
from
the
king
has
proven
even
more
difficult
FREDERIC
SIGHS
Sweetheart
I
know
this
new
life
is
hard
to
get
used
to
and
I'm
sure
that
sometimes
you
wish
I
would
get
out
of
your
hair
COUGHING
Oh
sorry
It's
a
little
dry
out
here
Anyone
else
dry
Rapunzel
you're
going
to
be
queen
someday
a
great
queen
with
a
magnificent
kingdom
But
you
know
better
than
anyone
else
what
a
dangerous
and
evil
place
the
world
can
be
The
barrier
keeping
us
safe
from
that
is
sometimes
more
fragile
than
it
appears
SCREAMING
When
that
evil
rears
its
ugly
head
it
is
my
job
to
protect
Corona
from
it
And
one
day
that
will
be
your
responsibility
And
I
must
teach
you
how
to
carry
it
But
that
is
many
many
years
away
Until
that
burden
is
imposed
on
you
I'm
asking
that
you
trust
me
That
I
know
how
to
keep
danger
as
far
away
from
you
and
this
kingdom
as
is
humanly
possible
Do
you
understand
It
wasn't
until
last
night
that
I
realized
that
my
methods
may
have
at
times
seemed
strict
or
unfair
or
Does
this
mean
I
can
have
more
time
to
myself
without
having
half
the
royal
guard
over
my
shoulder
Well
this
means
I'm
willing
to
reconsider
those
methods
But
I
make
no
promises
I
can
work
with
that
KISSES
Well
I
should
go
I
have
a
lot
of
princessing
up
to
do

WHISTLING

Oh
come
on
What
is
going
on
with
Rapunzel
I
mean
is
it
something
I
did
Probably
And
since
when
did
she
start
keeping
secrets
from
me
Hey
Fitzherbert
I
need
to
get
this
done
before
the
coronation
So
do
you
mind
throwing
your
pity

give
this

you
I

it's
a
little
early
for

I
thought
you
might
like
to
see
it
now
Eighteenth
of
July
we
embarked
on
a
safari
to
the
most
remote
plains
of
the
third
continent
Twentyfirst
of
May
had
to
take
shelter
in
a
hidden
cave
to
escape
the
fury
of
a
violent
storm
Twelfth
of
April
helped
villagers
rebuild
their
wrtorn
homes
Mom

this
yours
Did
you
actually
do
all
of
this
Rapunzel
before
I
met
your
father
I
was
so
much
like
you
I
had
no
idea
what
I
was
supposed
to
do
in
this
world
So
I
went
out
and
found
my
own
way
Your
father
is
right
about
one
thing
You
will
be
queen
someday
But
only
you
get
to
decide
what
kind
of
queen
you'll
be
And
no
one
can
tell
you
the
best
way
to
make
that
decision
But
how
can
I
if
Wait
Are
you
suggesting
that
I
should
Honey
find
a
way
to
fill
those
pages
I
only
ask
that
you
be
safe
be
smart

above

be

yourself

You

disappearance
your

locked
up
every
criminal
in
the

including
a
simple
petty
thief
my
father
I
saw
him
thrown
into
a
cage

hauled
off

I'd
come

folks
FREDERIC
So
I'm
trying
to
understand
this
You
snuck
out
last
night
went
beyond
the
walls
of
Corona
where
you
touched
a
mysterious
rock
that
somehow
caused
your
hair
to
return
Yes
And
you
acted
alone
Look
I
know
you're
angry
but
can't
you
see
I'm
okay
I'm
more
than
okay
I
Rapunzel
There's
something
I
need
to
tell
you
I
love
you
The
night
you
were
taken
a
part
of
me
died
the
best
part
of
me
For
long
and
agonizing
years
I
swore
that
if
somehow
someway
by
some
miracle
the
fates
decided
to
show
mercy
and
return
you
to
me
I
would
never
let
anything
happen
to
you
again
And
now
that
this
has
returned
the
very
reason
you
were
snatched
away
from
me
in
the
first
place
I'm
afraid
I'm
left
with
no
choice
sweetheart
As
of
tonight
I
am
forced
to
exercise
my
martial
right
as
king
to
forbid
you
from
leaving
the
walls
of
this
kingdom
without
my
consent
Father
And
know
this
this
is
the
last
we
will
speak
of
mystical
rocks
or
magic
of
any
kind
to
anyone
Is
that
understood
There
is
so
much
more
to
me
than
you
think
Hmm
KNOCKING
ON
DOOR
Come
in
I
believe
somebody
ordered
room
service
Eugene
how
did
you
know
I
had
a
feeling
Look
I
just
wanted
to
clear
some
stuff
up
I
haven't
apologized
for
putting
you
on
the
spot
with
that
proposal
Well
looking
back
storming
out
of
the
room
probably
wasn't
the
best
reaction
SIGHS
So
I'm
I'm
sorry
No
no
don't
apologize
Look
I'll
admit
I
don't
quite
understand
why
you
said
no
But
I
promise
to
do
everything
I
can
until
I
do
Thanks
Eugene
And
in
the
meantime
we'll
stay
right
here
and
take
things
slowly
I
miss
this
Hey
promise
me
one
more
thing
Anything
That
you'll
be
patient
with
me
Absolutely
Good
night
Rapunzel
Good
night
Eugene
Back
to
life
after
happily
ever
after
Stuck
inside
once
again
And
I'm
gazing
out
True
I'm
in
here
with
those
I
hold
dear
Surrounded
by
their
love
And
for
some
that's
more
than
enough
No
doubt
But
I
got
the
wind
in
my
hair
and
a
fire
within
'Cause
there's
something
beginning
I
got
a
mystery
to
solve
And
excitement
to
spare
That
beautiful
breeze
blowin'
through
I'm
ready
to
follow
it
who
knows
where
And
I'll
get
there
I
swear
With
the
wind
in
my
hair
Seems
like
I've
spent
my
whole
life
hopin'
Dreamin'
of
things
I've
never
tried
Tangled
in
knots
just
waitin'
for
my
time
to
shine
What
if
the
doors
began
to
open
What
if
the
knots
became
untied
What
if
one
day
nothing
stood
in
my
way
And
the
world
was
mine
Would
it
feel
this
fine
'Cause
I've
got
the
wind
in
my
hair
And
a
gleam
in
my
eyes
And
an
endless
horizon
I
got
a
smile
on
my
face
And
I'm
walkin'
on
air
And
everything
life
ought
to
be
It's
all
gonna
happen
to
me
out
there
And
I'll
find
it
I
swear
With
the
wind
in
my
hair
So
many
roads
I've
yet
to
travel
So
many
friends
I
haven't
met
So
many
new
adventures
Just
around
the
bend
Plenty
of
mysteries
to
unravel
Tons
of
mistakes
to
not
regret
So
much
to
see
and
to
do
and
to
be
A
whole
life
to
spend
And
it
doesn't
end
'Cause
I've
got
the
wind
in
my
hair
and
a
song
in
my
heart
And
the
fun's
only
starting
I
got
a
skip
in
my
step
And
I
haven't
a
care
That
beautiful
breeze
blowin'
through
It's
gonna
carry
me
who
knows
where
But
I'll
take
any
dare
With
the
wind
in
my
hair
I
got
a
smile
on
my
face
and
I'm
walking
on
air
And
everything
life
ought
to
be
I
know
that
it's
waiting
for
me
out
there
And
I'll
find
it
I
swear
With
the
wind
in
my
hair

Evening

So
make
a
wish
and
hold
on
tight
There's
magic
in
the
air
tonight
And
anything
can
happen
Just
in
that
moment
the
ugly
little
frog
looked
up
with
his
sad
round
eyes
and
pleaded
Oh
please
dear
princess
Only
a
kiss
from
you
can
break
this
terrible
spell
that
was
inflicted
on
me
by
a
wicked
witch
There
comes
my
favorite
part
And
the
beautiful
princess
was
so
moved
by
his
desperate
plea
that
she
stooped
down
picked
up
the
slippery
creature
leaned
forward
raised
him
to
her
lips
and
kissed
that
little
frog
Than
the
frog
was
transformed
into
a
handsome
prince
They
were
married
and
lived
happily
ever
after
The
end
Yay
Read
it
again
read
it
again

Lawrence
We

drink
With

At
this
point
you
have
two
choices
Woo
and
marry
richa
lady
or
Get
a
job
All

but
first
We
dance
This
is
idiocy
For
someone
who
can't
see
his
feet
you're
very
light
on
them
It's
perfect
You're
finally
getting
into
the
music
Do

my
joke
Because
your
head

in
the
tuba
Get

Lawrence
Lawrence
This
remarkable
gentleman

my
palm
Or
this
morning's
newspaper

charlatan
I

a
less
Don't
you
disrespect
me
little
man
Don't
you
derogate
or
deride
You're
in
my
world
now
Not
your
world
And
I've
got
friends
on
the
other
side
He's
got
friends
on
the
other
side
That's
just
an
echo

little
somethin'

Louisiana
a
little
parlor
trick
Don't
worry
Sit
down
at
my

anything

can
read
your
future
I
can
change
it
'round
some
too
I'll
look
deep
into
your
heart
and
soul

have
a
soul

Lawrence
Make
your
wildest
dreams
come
true
I
got
voodoo

got
hoodoo
I
got
things

tried
And
I
got
friends
on
the
other
side
He's
got
friends
on
the
other
side
The
cards

Take
a
little
trip
into
your
future
with
me
Now

young
man
are
from
across
the
sea
You
come
from
two
long
lines
of
royalty
I'm
a
royal
myself
on
my
mother's
side
Your
lifestyle's
high
But
your
funds
are
low
You
need
to
marry
a
little
honey
whose
daddy
got
dough
Mommy
and
daddy
cut
you
off
huh
playboy
Yeah
sad
but
true
Now
y'all
gotta
get
hitched
but
hitchin'
ties
you
down
You
just
wanna
be
free
Hop
from
place
to
place
But
freedom
takes
green
It's
the
green
it's
the
green
it's
the
green
you
need
And
when
I
looked
into
your
future
It's
the
green
that
I
see
On
you
little
man
I
don't
want
to
waste
much
time
You
been
pushed
around
all
your
life
You
been
pushed
around
by
your
mother
and
your
sister
and
your
brother
And
if
you
was
married
You'd
be
pushed
around
by
your
wife
But
in
your
future
the
you
I
see
It's
exactly
the
man
you
always
wanted
to
be
Shake
my
hand
Come
on
boys
Won't
you
shake
the
poor
sinner's
hand
Are
you
ready

It's
going
to
be
very
long
night
Oh

You

so
quiet
You

The
poor
dear
frog
was
scarfing
so
I
loosened
the
lid
and
How
do
I
ever
get
tangled
up
in
all
this
voodoo
madness
I
can't
get
through
with
this
You
wear
this
this
ghostly
flinger
Amulet
Anything
happens
to
this
I'm
gonna
need
Fun
fact
about
voodoo
Larry
Can
counter
a
thing
for
myself
Besides
you
and
I
both
know
the
real
power
in
this
world
ain't
magic
It's
money
Lots
of
it
It's
true
Aren't
you
tired
of
living
on
a
smidgens
While
all
those
fat
cats
in
their
fancy
cars
don't
give
you
so
much
of
a
sideway's
glance
Yes
I
am
All
you
got
to
do
is
marry
Big
Daddy's
little
princess

said
But
What
about
Naveen
You
little
slipup
We
will
be
a
minor
bump
in
the
road
so
long
as
we
got
the
prince's
blood
in
this
Voodoo
You
mean
to
tell
me
this
all
happened
because
you
were
messing
with
the
Shadow
Man
He
was
very
charismatic
It
serves
me
right
for
wishing
on
stars
The
only
way
to
get
what
you
want
in
this
world
is
through
hard
work
Hard
work
Why
why
would
a
princess
need
to
work
hard
Huh
Oh
I'm
not
a
princess
I'm
a
waitress
A
waitress

Leech

your
loneliness
my
friend
Abenaza
Cute
but

had
me
a
crazy
idea
What
about
if
I
ask
Mama
Odie
to
turn
me
human
Louis
you
are
a
genius
Hallelujah
If
I
were
a
human
being
I'd
head
straight
for
New
Orleans
and
I'd
blow
this
horn
so
hot
and
strong
like
no
one
they'd
ever
seen
Louis
Armstrong
Mister
Sydney
Bechet
All
the
boys
gonna
step
aside
when
they
hear
this
old
Alligator
play
Listen
When
I'm
human
as
I
hope
to
be
I'm
gonna
blow
this
horn
till
the
cows
come
home
and
everyone's
gonna
bow
down
to
me
Thank
you
Thank
you
Aw
thank
you
I
love
you
too
baby
When
I'm
myself
again
I
want
just
the
life
I
had
Aye
that
doesn't
sound
too
bad
a
redhead
on
my
left
arm
a
brunette
on
my
right
a
blonde
or
two
to
hold
a
candle
that
seem
just
about
right
Eh
Louis
Life
is
short
when
you're
done
you're
done
we're
on
this
Earth
to
have
some
fun
and
that's
the
way
things
are
Say
it
brother
When
I'm
human
and
I'm
gonna
be
I'm
gonna
tear
it
up
like
I
did
before
that's
a
royal
guarantee
You
are
getting
married
All
right
I
just
have
to
leave
a
string
of
broken
hearts
behind
me
Your
modesty
becomes
you
and
your
sense
of
responsibility
I
worked
hard
for
everything
I
got
and
that's
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be
When
I'm
a
human
being
at
least
I'll
act
like
one
if
you
do
your
best
each
and
every
day
good
things
are
sure
to
come
your
way
What
you
give
is
what
you
get
My
daddy
said
that
and
now
I'll
never
forget
and
I
amend
it
to
you
When
we're
human
and
we're
gonna
be
I'm
gonna
blow
my
horn
I'm
gonna
live
the
high
life
I'm
gonna
do
my
best
to
take
my
place
in
the
sun
When
we're
human

Just

Shadow

It's

Think
of
everything
you
sacrificed
Girl
all
you
ever

Think
of
all
those
maecenas
who
doubted
you
You
ain't
never
gonna
get
enough
for
the
dang
payment
Woman
of
your
background
you
better
off
will
y'all
And
don't
forget
your
poor
Daddy
Now

was
one
hard
working
man
See
you
tomorrow
James
Double
sometimes
triple
shifts
Never
let
know
how
bone
tired
beat
darlin'
really
was
Daddy
Hey
babby
cakes
Shame
on
that
hard
work
didn't
amount
much
more
than
a
busted
up
old
gumbo
pot
And
a
dream
that
never
get
off
the
back
porch
But
you
You
can
give
your
poor
Daddy
everything
he
ever
wanted
Come
on
Tiana
You're
almost
there
My
Daddy
never
did
get
what
he
wanted
But
he
had
what
he
needed
He
had
love
Never
lost
a
sight
what
was
really
important
Easy
with
that
Careful
And
neither
will
I
Y'all
should've
taken
my
deal
Now

spend
the
rest
of
your
life
bein'
a
slimy
little
frog
I

lots
more
plans
Are
you

This
is
just
a
minor
setback
in
a
major
operation
As
soon
as
I

another
spell
we'll
be
back
in

that
froggy

little
more
time

Hear

Who

POWHATAN
I
told
him
it
would
make
my
heart
soar
POCAHONTAS
But
hes
so
serious
POWHATAN
My
daughter
Kocoum
will
make
a
fine
husband
He
is
loyal
and
strong
and
will
build
you
a
good
house
with
sturdy
walls
With
him
you
will
be
safe
from
harm
POCAHONTAS
Father
I
think
my
dream
is
pointing
me
down
another
path
POWHATAN
This
is
the
right
path
for
you
POCAHONTAS
But
why
cant
I
choose
POWHATAN
Pocahontas
come
with
me
You
are
the
daughter
of
the
chief
It
is
time
to
take
your
place
among
our
people
Even
the
wild
mountain
stream
must
someday
join
the
big
river
As
the
river
cuts
his
path
Though
the
rivers
proud
and
strong
He
will
choose
the
smoothest
course
Thats
why
rivers
live
so
long
Theyre
steady
as
the
steady
beating
drum
Your
mother
wore
this
for
our
wedding
It
was
her
dream
to
see
you
wear
it
at
your
own
It
suits
you
Transition
to
Pocahontas
alone
at
the
riverside
POCAHONTAS
He
wants
me
to
be
steady
Like
the
river
But
its
not
steady
at
all
What
I
love
most
about
rivers
is
You
cant
step
in
the
same
river
twice
The
waters
always
changing
always
flowing
But
people
I
guess
cant
live
like
that
We
all
must
pay
a
price
To
be
safe
we
lose
our
chance
of
ever
knowing
Whats
around
the
riverbend
Waiting
just
around
the
riverbend
I
look
once
more
Just
about
the
riverbend
Beyond
the
shore
Where
the
gulls
fly
free
Dont
know
what
for
What
I
dream
the
day
might
send
Just
around
the
riverbend
For
me
Coming
for
me
I
feel
it
there
beyond
those
trees
Or
right
behind
these
waterfalls
Can
I
ignore
that
sound
of
distant
drumming
For
a
handsome
sturdy
husband
Who
builds
handsome
sturdy
walls
And
never
dreams
that
something
might
be
coming
Just
around
the
riverbend
Just
around
the
riverbend
I
look
once
more
Just
around
the
riverbend
Beyond
the
shore
Somewhere
past
the
sea
Dont
know
what
for
Why
do
all
my
dreams
extend
Just
around
the
riverbend
Just
around
the
riverbend
Should
I
choose
the
smoothest
course
Steady
as
the
beating
drum
Should
I
marry
Kocoum
Is
all
my
dreaming
at
an
end
Or
do
you
still
wait
for
me
Dream
Giver
Just
around
the
riverbend
Transition
to
Pocahontas
arriving
at
Grandmother

GRANDMOTHER

GRANDMOTHER
WILLOW
Kocoum
But

so
serious
POCAHONTAS
I
know
My
father
thinks
its
the
right
path
for
me
But

As

to
spin
GRANDMOTHER
WILLOW
A
spinning
arrow
How
unusual
POCAHONTAS
Yes
It
spins
faster
and
faster
and
faster
until
suddenly
it
stops
GRANDMOTHER
WILLOW
Hmm
Well
seems
to
me
this
spinning
arrow
is
pointing
you
down
your
path
POCAHONTAS
But
Grandmother
Willow

my
path
How

I
ever
going
to
find
it
GRANDMOTHER
WILLOW
Chuckle
Your
mother
asked
me
the
very
same
question
POCAHONTAS
She
did
What
did
you
tell
her
GRANDMOTHER
WILLOW
I
told
her
to
listen
All
around
you
are
spirits
child
They

If

Que

You

Listen

heart
You

Let

SMITH
Were
going
to

people
how
to

this
land
properly
How

make
the
most
of
it
POCAHONTAS
Make
the
most
of
it
JOHN
SMITH
Yes
well
build
roads
and
decent
houses
and
POCAHONTAS
Our
houses
are
fine
JOHN
SMITH
You
think
that
only
because
you
dont
know
any
better
Pocahontas
starts
to
leave
Wait
a
minute
dont
take
it
that
Flit
attacks
him
Hey
hey
wait
Wait
wait
Theres
so
much
we
can
teach
you
Weve
improved
the
lives
of
savages
all
over
the
world
POCAHONTAS
Savages
JOHN
SMITH
Uh
not
that
youre
a
savage
POCAHONTAS
Just
my
people
JOHN
SMITH
No
listen
thats
not
what
I
meant
Let
me
explain
POCAHONTAS
Let
go
JOHN
SMITH
No
Im
not
letting
you
leave
Look
dont
do
this
Savage
is
just
a
word
You
know
A
term
for
people
who
are
uncivilized
POCAHONTAS
Like
me
JOHN
SMITH
Well
when
I
say
uncivilized
what
I
mean
is
is
POCAHONTAS
What
you
mean
is
not
like
you
You
think
Im
an
ignorant
savage
And
youve
been
so
many
places
I
guess
it
must
be
so
But
still
I
cannot
see
If
the
savage
one
is
me
How
can
there
be
so
much
that
you
dont
know
You
dont
know
You
think
you
own
whatever
land
you
land
on
The
earth
is
just
a
dead
thing
you
can
claim
But
I
know
every
rock
and
tree
and
creature
Has
a
life
has
a
spirit
has
a
name
You
think
the
only
people
who
are
people
Are
the
people
who
look
and
think
like
you
But
if
you
walk
the
footsteps
of
a
stranger
Youll
learn
things
you
never
knew
you
never
knew
Have
you
ever
heard
the
wolf
cry
to
the
bluecorn
moon
Or
asked
the
grinning
bobcat
why
he
grinned
Can
you
sing
with
all
the
voices
of
the
mountain
Can
you
paint
with
all
the
colors
of
the
wind
Can
you
paint
with
all
the
colors
of
the
wind
Come
run
the
hidden
pine
trails
of
the
forest
Come
taste
the
sun
sweet
berries
of
the
earth
Come
roll
in
all
the
riches
all
around
you
And
for
once
never
wonder
what
theyre
worth
The
rainstorm
and
the
river
are
my
brothers
The
heron
and
the
otter
are
my
friends
And
we
are
all
connected
to
each
other
In
a
circle
in
a
hoop
that
never
ends
How
high
does
the
sycamore
grow
If
you
cut
it
down
then
youll
never
know
And
youll
never
hear
the
wolf
cry
to
the
bluecorn
moon
For
whether
we
are
white
or
copperskinned
We
need
to
sing
with
all
the
voices
of
the
mountain
We
need
to
paint
with
all
the
colors
of
the
wind
You
can
own
the
earth
and
still
All
youll
own
is
earth
until
You
can
paint
with
all
the
colors
of
the
wind
JOHN

POWHATAN
They

Merida
quickly
moves
to
hide
somewhere
else
Hmm

Birthday

Im

up
when
I

Merida

up
behind
Elinor
and
goes
to
run
away
but
Elinor
catches
her
Im
going
to
eat
you
she
pretends
to
eat
Merida
and
they
both
laugh
as
Elinor
and
young
Merida
play
Fergus
places
his
bow
on
the
table
Ach
Fergus
no
weapons
on
the
table
Merida
runs
towards
the
table
Young
Merida
Can
I
shoot
an
arrow
she
picks
up
the
large
bow
from
the
table
Can
I
Can
I
Can
I
Can
I
Please

I
she
falls
on
her
butt
and
laughs
as
the
bow
is
too
big
for
her
Fergus
chuckles
Not
with
that
Why
not
use
your
very
own
he
presents
her
with
a
small
bow
as
Fergus
teaches
young
Merida
how
to
shoot
with
her
bow
Merida
misses
the
target
Now
theres
a
good
girl
Listen
Draw
all
the
way
back
now
to
your
cheek
Thats
right
keep
both
eyes
open
andboost
Merida
shoots
and
misses
the
target
again
Young
Merida
I
missed
it
Elinor
Go
and
fetch
it
then
As
Merida
runs
off
to
fetch
the
bow
Elinor
turns
to
Fergus
A
bow
Fergus
Shes
a
lady
Fergus
playfully
pinches
Elinors
butt
making
her
yelp
and
he
laughs
As
Merida
seeks
her
missed
arrow
in
the
forest
and
finds
it
something
feels
strange
she
turns
and
sees
a
floating
blue
light
Young
Merida
A
Will
O
the
Wisp
Merida
runs
towards
it
and
tries
to
catch
the
wisp
but
it
flies
away
They
are
real
Merida
then
sees
a
line
of
wisps
and
goes
after
them
excitedly
Elinor
calls
out
to
her
Elinor
Merida
Come
on
sweetheart
were
leaving
now
Merida
runs
back
towards
her
parents
Young
Merida
I
saw
a
wisp
I
saw
a
wisp
Elinor
A
wisp
You
know
some
say
that
Will
O
the
Wisps
lead
you
to
your
fate
Fergus
Oh
aye
Or
an
arrow
Come
on
lets
be
off
Before
we
see
a
dancing
charging
bubu
or
a
giant
Fergus
walks
off
and
Elinor
picks
up
Merida
Elinor
Your
father
doesnt
believe
in
magic
Young
Merida
Well
he
should
cause
its
true
Suddenly
a
huge
black
bear
comes
behind
Elinor
and
Merida
making
Merida
scream
with
terror
Fergus
hears
her
screaming
and
turns
around
Fergus
Mordu
Elinor
run
Elinor
and
Merida
run
off
one
of
Fergus
men
passes
a
spear
to
him
Fergus
charges
towards
Mordu
but
he
snaps
off
Fergus
spear
While
Elinor
and
Merida
escape
on
horseback
Fergus
holds
up
his
sword
at
Mordu
and
shouts
Come
on
you
Mordu
roars
and
lunges
forward
and
the
screen
goes
blank
Merida
voice
over
Some
say
our
destiny
is
tied
to
the
land
as
much
a
part
of
us
as
we
are
of
it
Others
say
fate
is
woven
together
like
a
cloth
so
that
ones
destiny
intertwines
with
many
others
Its
the
one
thing
we
search
for
or
fight
to
change
Some
never
find
it
But
there
are
some
who
are
led
The
story
of
how
my
father
lost
his
leg
to
the
demon
bear
Mordu
became
legend
I
became
a
sister
to
three
new
brothers
the
princes
Hamish
Hubert
and
Harris
Wee
devils
more
like
They
get
away
with
murder
I
can
never
get
away
with
anything
we
see
Merida
now
a
teenager
talking
about
her
life
as
the
doors
to
the
palace
open
we
see
Merida
biting
into
an
apple
and
Elinor
looking
disappointed
Im
the
princess
Im
the
example
Merida
quickly
discards
the
apple
and
wipes
her
mouth
with
the
back
of
her
hand
and
starts
walking
towards
her
parents
Ive
got
duties
responsibilities
expectations
My
whole
life
is
planned
out
until
the
day
I
become
well
my
mother
Shes
in
charge
of
every
single
day
of
my
life
We
see
Merida
reciting
a
traditional
English
song
in
a
monotone
voice
and
looking
bored
Merida
A
Robyn
jolly
Robyn
and
thou
shalt
knowe
of
myn
Elinor
Project
Merida
projects
her
voice
louder
Merida
And
thou
shalt
knowe
of
myn
Elinor
Pronounciate
You
must
be
understood
from
anywhere
in
the
room
or
its
all
for
naught
Merida
mutters
to
herself
Merida
This
is
all
for
naught
Elinor
I
heard
that
From
the
top
We
see
Elinor
teaching
Merida
geography
A
princess
must
be
knowledgeable
about
her
kingdom
she
takes
away
the
paper
that
Merida
is
writing
on
and
holds
it
up
She
doesnt
make
doodle
we
see
Elinor
teaching
Merida
how
to
play
the
lyre
which
sounds
out
of
tune
Thats
a
C
dear
then
we
see
Merida
holding
a
bird
with
Fergus
standing
beside
her
as
Merida
tries
to
feed
the
bird
it
flies
off
and
attacks
Fergus
Merida
starts
laughing
as
Fergus
tries
to
fend
off
the
bird
A
princess
does
not
chortle
then
we
see
Merida
trying
to
stuff
a
big
bite
of
chicken
in
her
mouth
at
the
dinner
table
Doesnt
stuff
her
gob
then
we
see
Elinor
opening
the
curtains
in
Meridas
room
to
wake
Merida
Rises
early
then
in
the
kitchen
Is
compassionate
then
at
the
Kings
throne
Patient
at
the
dining
hall
Cautious
in
Meridas
room
Clean
then
we
see
Elinor
with
Fergus
walking
passed
Merida
And
above
all
a
princess
strives
for
Well
perfection
we
see
Merida
waking
up
getting
dressed
taking
her
bow
and
arrows
running
downstairs
to
her
horse
Angus
and
riding
off
Merida
voice
over
But
every
once
in
a
while
theres
a
day
when
I
dont
have
to
be
a
princess
No
lessons
no
expectations
A
day
where
anything
can
happen
A
day
when
I
can
change
my
fate
we
see
Merida
as
she
riding
into
the
forest
shooting
her
arrows
at
different
targets
then
sitting
near
the
cliffs
edge
and
carves
on
her
bow
then
see
climbs
a
rock
and
when
she
reaches
the
top
she
drinks
from
the
waterfall
nearby
and
the
screams
and
jumps
up
and
down
in
excitement
as
Merida
finally
returns
to
the
castle
she
jumps
off
Angus
Im
starving
Youre
hungry
too
I
guess
Merida
pats
Angus
and
he
strikes
her
with
his
tail
Poof
then
Merida
enters
the
kitchen
and
is
greeted
by
the
kitchen
staff
Merida
then
sneakes
some
food
from
the
table
and
enters
the
dining
hall
she
goes
and
hears
her
father
reciting
his
tale
of
his
fight
with
Mordu
Fergus
From
nowhere
the
biggest
bear
youve
ever
seen
Its
hide
littered
with
the
weapons
of
fallen
warriors
Its
face
scarred
with
one
dead
eye
I
threw
my
sword
and
Merida
WHOOSH
One
swipe
his
sword
shattered
then
CHOMP
Dads
leg
was
clean
off
Down
that
monsters
throat
it
went
Fergus
Awwwwww
Thats
my
favorite
part
Merida
Mordu
has
never
been
seen
since
And
hes
roaming
the
wild
awaiting
his
chance
for
revenge
ROOOAAR
Fergus
Let
him
return
Ill
finish
what
I
gobbled
in
the
first
place
Merida
places
her
bow
on
the
table
Elinor
Merida
a
princess
does
not
place
her
weapons
on
the
table
Merida
Mama
Its
just
my
bow
Elinor
A
princess
should
not
have
weaponry
in
my
opinion
Fergus
Leave
her
be
Princess
or
not
learning
to
fight
is
essential
Merida
Mum
youll
never
guess
what
I
did
today
Elinor
Hmm
Merida
I
climbed
the
Crones
Tooth
and
drank
from
the
Fire
Falls
Fergus
Fire
Falls
They
say
only
the
ancient
kings
were
brave
enough
to
drink
the
fire
Fergus
laughs
and
winks
at
Merida
Elinor
is
distracted
as
shes
reading
a
letter
Elinor
What
did
you
do
dear
Merida
is
disappointed
as
Elinor
hadnt
heard
her
story
Merida
Nothing
mum
referring
to
Meridas
plate
of
desserts
shes
brought
to
the
dinner
table
Elinor
Hungry
arent
we
Merida
Mum
Elinor
Youll
get
dreadful
collywobbles
Oh
Fergus
Will
you
look
at
your
daughters
plate
Fergus
looks
as
hes
about
to
take
a
bite
from
his
large
pile
of
food
on
his
plate
referring
to
the
letters
that
have
just
arrived
Fergus
Theyve
all
accepted
Merida
Whos
accepted
what
Mother
Elinor
turns
to
the
triplets
Elinor
Boys
you
are
excused
the
triplets
quickly
make
their
exit
Merida
Whaaat
Did
I
do
Now
Elinor
Your
father
has
something
to
discuss
with
you
surprised
by
this
Fergus
suddenly
spits
out
what
he
was
drinking
Fergus
Fergus
nervously
clears
his
throat
Fergus
Merida
Fergus
hesitates
not
knowing
what
to
say
Elinor
The
lords
are
presenting
their
sons
as
suitors
for
your
betrothal
Merida
What
Elinor
The
clans
have
accepted
Merida
DAD
Fergus
What
I
You
She
Elinor
Elinor
Honestly
Merida
I
dont
know
why
youre
acting
this
way
This
year
each
clan
will
present
a
suitor
to
compete
in
the
games
for
your
hand
Merida
I
suppose
a
princess
just
does
what
shes
told
Elinor
A
princess
does
not
raise
her
voice
Merida
this
is
what
youve
been
preparing
for
your
whole
life
Merida
No
Its
what
youve
been
preparing
me
for
my
whole
life
Merida
gets
up
in
anger
and
starts
to
walk
off
I
wont
go
through
with
it
You
cant
make
me
Elinor
Merida
Merida
angrily
storms
out
of
the
Great
Hall
to
her
bedroom
Fergus
Merida
Fergus
gets
up
to
go
after
her
but
knocks
down
the
entire
dinner
table
instead
making
the
dogs
attack
the
food
BOYYYS
as
Merida
is
striking
her
bedposts
with
her
sword
Elinor
enters
Merida
Mother
Suitors
Marriage
Elinor
Once
there
was
an
ancient
kingdom
Merida
Ah
Mum
Ancient
kingdom
Elinor
Its
name
long
forgotten
ruled
by
a
wise
and
fair
king
who
was
much
beloved
And
when
he
grew
old
he
divided
the
kingdom
among
his
four
sons
That
they
should
be
the
pillars
on
which
their
piece
of
land
rested
But
the
oldest
prince
wanted
to
rule
the
land
for
himself
he
followed
his
own
path
and
the
kingdom
fell
from
war
and
chaos
and
ruin
Merida
sarcastically
Thats
a
nice
story
Elinor
Its
not
just
a
story
Merida
Legends
are
lessons
and
they
ring
with
truths
Merida
Ach
mummy
Elinor
I
would
advise
you
to
make
your
peace
with
this
The
clans
are
coming
to
present
their
suitors
Merida
Its
not
fair
Elinor
Oh
Merida
Its
marriage
its
not
the
end
of
the
world
Elinor
walks
out
of
Meridas
room
and
Merida
slams
the
door
shut
in
anger
Elinor
mutters
to
herself
as
she
works
on
embroidering
a
tapestry
of
their
family
when
Fergus
walks
in
Fergus
Youre
muttering
Elinor
I
dont
mutter
Fergus
Aye
you
do
You
mutter
lass
when
somethings
troubling
you
Elinor
I
blame
you
Stubbornness
is
entirely
from
your
side
of
the
family
Fergus
I
take
it
the
talk
didnt
go
too
well
Elinor
I
dont
know
what
to
do
Fergus
Speak
to
her
dear
Elinor
I
do
speak
to
her
she
just
doesnt
listen
Fergus
Come
on
now
Pretend
Im
Merida
Speak
to
me
What
would
you
say
Elinor
I
cant
do
this
Fergus
Sure
you
can
Elinor
makes
a
face
at
him
There
There
Thats
my
queen
Right
here
we
go
he
starts
talking
in
a
high
pitched
girlie
voice
pretending
to
be
Merida
I
dont
want
to
get
married
I
want
to
stay
single
and
let
my
hair
flow
in
the
wind
as
I
ride
through
the
glen
firing
arrows
into
the
sunset
Elinor
decides
to
explain
to
Fergus
what
she
wishes
she
could
explain
to
Merida
Elinor
decides
to
explain
to
Fergus
what
she
wishes
she
could
explain
to
Merida
Elinor
Merida
all
this
work
all
the
time
spent
preparing
you
schooling
you
giving
you
everything
we
never
had
I
ask
you
what
do
you
expect
us
to
do
we
see
that
Merida
is
now
talking
to
her
horse
telling
him
everything
she
wishes
she
could
tell
her
mother
Merida
Call
off
the
gathering
Would
that
kill
them
Youre
the
queen
you
can
just
tell
the
lords
the
princess
is
not
ready
for
this
In
fact
she
might
not
be
ever
ready
for
this
So
thats
that
Looking
at
you
So
you
expect
your
declarations
of
war
in
the
morning
Elinor
continues
to
tell
Fergus
what
she
wishes
to
tell
Merida
Elinor
I
understand
this
must
all
seem
unfair
even
I
have
reservations
when
I
faced
betrothal
Elinor
We
cant
just
run
away
from
who
we
are
we
go
back
to
Merida
talking
to
her
horse
telling
it
what
she
wants
to
tell
her
mother
Merida
I
dont
want
my
life
to
be
over
I
want
my
freedom
the
scene
then
goes
back
and
forth
between
Elinor
talking
to
Fergus
and
Merida
talking
to
her
horse
but
it
seems
like
they
are
talking
to
each
other
Elinor
But
are
you
willing
to
pay
the
price
your
freedom
will
cost
Merida
Im
not
doing
any
of
this
to
hurt
you
Elinor
If
you
could
just
try
to
see
what
I
do
I
do
out
of
love
Merida
But
its
my
life
It's
Im
just
not
ready
Elinor
I
think
youd
see
if
you
could
just
Merida
I
think
I
could
make
you
understand
if
you
would
just
Elinor
Listen
Merida
LISTEN
Meridas
horse
neighs
in
response
I
swear
Angus
this
isnt
going
to
happen
Not
if
I
can
help
it
Elinor
dresses
Merida
in
a
horribly
uncomfortable
and
tight
formal
dress
Elinor
You
look
absolutely
beautiful
Merida
II
cant
breath
Elinor
Give
us
a
twirl
stiffly
Merida
twirls
Merida
I
cant
move
Its
too
tight
Elinor
Its
perfect
Elinor
looks
at
Merida
in
compassion
Merida
Merida
Mama
Elinor
Just
Remember
to
smile
she
turns
and
walks
off
Fergus
to
the
crowd
as
the
clans
gather
to
present
their
sons
So
here
we
are
The
four
clans
Uh

Elinor
exasperated
by
Fergus
slowness
gets
up
and
finishes
his
sentence
Elinor
The

Fergus
quickly
follows
on
from
his

Fergus
The

and
vanquished

more
the

cheers
as
young
Macintosh
steps
forward
to
display
his
sword
skills
after
that
he
poses
and
flexes
his

to
impress
the

Lord

I

who
was
besieged
by
ten
thousand
romans
and
he
took
out
their
whole
armor
single
handedly
with
one
arm

was
Suddenly
we
see
Dingwall
pull
his
son
who
is
small
and
weedy
looking
from
behind
the
tall
young
warrior
With
one
arm
he
was
steering
the
ship
and
with
the
other
he
held
his
mighty
sword
and
struck
down
a
whole
attacking
fleet
suddenly
a
voice
in
the
crowd
shouts
Voice

he
shouts
to
his
son
Wee
Dingwall
suddenly
Wee
Dingwall
jumps
onto
Lord
Macintosh
and
with
his
big
teeth
bites
into
his
arm
and
with
that
a
brawl
breaks
out
with
everyone
fighting
each
other
Fergus
stops
the
clans
fighting
Fergus
Now

decorum
And

the
triplets
sneak
up
and
smash
Lord
Dingwalls
toe
as
he
shouts
in
pain
he
gets
hit
in
the
face
and
the
fighting
starts
all
over
again
with
Fergus
jumping
in
to
join
the
fight
Elinor
then
gets
up
walks
through
the
crowd
and
brings

and
takes
his
seat
Elinor
Now

of

of
the
great
leaders
may
be
presented
as
champion
Merida
to
herself
on
hearing
this
First
born
Elinor
And
thus
compete
for
the
hand
of
the
princess
of
DunBroch
To
win
the
fair
maiden
they
must
prove
their
worth
by
feets
of
strength
or
arms
in
the
games
It
is
customary
for
the
challenge
be
determined
by
the
princess
herself
Merida
quickly
shouts
out
Merida
Archery
Archery
Elinor
looks
at
Merida
and
Merida
then
says
gracefully
I
choose
Archery
Elinor
Elinor
turns
to
the
crowd
Let
the
games

cheers
as

young
clans
sons
get
ready
to
shoot
their
arrows
Fergus
Oi
Get
on
with
it
young
MacGuffin
shoots
first
but
hits
the
edge
of
the
target
Merida
feeling
pleased
turns
to
her
father
Merida
I
bet
he
wishes
he
was
tossing
cabers
Fergus
Holding
up
bridges
Fergus
and
Merida
laugh
and
Elinor
scoffs
at
them
after
young
Macintosh
hits
his
bow
and
just
misses
the
center
of
the
target
Young
Macintosh
NOOO
AAAHHH
Lord
Macintosh
At
least

hit
the
target
young
Macintosh
starts
throwing
a
tantrum
Merida
Oh

in
anger
young
Macintosh
throws
his
bow
someone
in
the
crowd
catches
it
and
shouts

young
Dingwalls

archery
he
struggles
to
hold
the
bow
Lord
Dingwall
Well

Well

Lord
Dingwall
does
a
little
victory
dance
and
then
bends
and
lifts
his
kilt
up
at
Lord
Macintosh
and
MacGuffin
after
young
Dingwall
has
won
the
archery
in
shock
Fergus
turns
to
Elinor
Fergus
Well

Guess

Elinor
Fergus
Fergus
By

Ding
Fergus
turns
to
face
his
daughter
but
sees
a
dog
in
her
seat
instead
then
we
see
Merida
in
a
black
cape
and
has
gone
onto
the
field
she
addresses
the
crowd
Merida
I

Merida
First
born
descendant
of
Clan
DunBroch
And
Ill

shooting
for
my

hand
Elinor
What
are
you

Merida
As
Merida
prepares
to
take
aim
she
finds
moving
difficult
as
her
dress
is
too
tight
Merida
Curse
this
dress
she
bends
and
her
dress
rips
at
the
back
and
arms
allowing
her
to
move
freely
she
aims
and
hits
the
first
target
dead
on
center
Elinor
Merida
stop
this
Merida
moves
to
the
second
target
aims
and
shoots
center
again
Don't

arrow
Merida
takes
another
arrow
and
prepares
to
shoot
the
third
target
Merida
I
FORBID
it
at
that
moment
Merida
shoot
the
arrow
and
hits
the
center
of
the
target
splitting
young
Dingwalls
arrow
in
half
after
Meridas
actions
at
the
clan
gathering
Elinor
drags
and
throws
Merida
into
the
tapestry
room
Elinor

Merida
points
her

at
the
family
tapestry
that

been

on
Elinor

Merida
MUM
Elinor
throws
Meridas
bow
at
the
fire
shocked
at

Merida
runs
out
of
the
room
Elinor
Merida
Merida
Elinor
immediately
regrets
her
actions
and
pulls
the
bow
out
of
the
fire
before
it
burns
Oh

done
Oh
she
begins
to
weep
after
tearfully
running
away
from
the
castle
Merida
sobs
as
she
rides
Angus
until
they
come
across
the
Ring
of
Stones
and
a
trail
of
will
o
the
wisps
leads
them
to
a
cottage
where
an
old
woman
is
making
wood
carvings
of
bears
Merida
sobs
Angus
The
Witch

Merida
Uh

woodcarver
Merida

bear
woodcarvings
Merida
notices
the
old
womans
broom

sweeping
the
floor
by
itself
Merida
Your
broom
the
old
woman
snaps
her
finger
and
the
broom
falls
to
the
ground
It
was
sweeping
by
itself
The
Witch
Thats

Of

to

the
crow
it
suddenly
snaps
its
beak
and
speaks
The
Crow
Staring
is
rude
Merida
Aah
The
crows

The
Crow
That's
not
what
I

Lalalalala
suddenly
the
old
woman
snaps
her
finger
and
the
broom
lifts
by
itself
and
knocks
the
crow
out
and
sweeps
it
across
the
floor
Merida
Youre

The
Witch
Woodcarver
Merida
Thats

The

Woodcarver
Merida

witch
uses
her
powers
to
float
knives
towards
Merida
forcing
her
out
of
the
cottage
Merida
Ill

suddenly
the
floating

in
midair
The
Witch
What
Whats

Merida
Every
carving
the
floating
knives
suddenly
point
away
from
Merida
The
Witch
And

With

The

the

witch
tries

but
Merida
pulls

away
Merida
Every

The
Witch
Are

Merida
I

That

The
Witch
Done
the
witch
quickly
grabs
the
necklace
after
agreeing
to
give
Merida
a
spell
the
witch
walks
out
of
her
cottage
and
then
walks
back
towards
her
cottage
Merida
Where
are
you
going
What
are
you
doing
The
Witch
Never
conjure
where
you
carve
very
important
she
opens
her
cottage
door
and
inside
the
cottage
everything
has
changed
The
last
time
I
did
this
was
for
a
prince
The
Crow
Easy
on
the
eyes
Fantastic
The
Witch
He
demanded
I
give
him
the
strength
of
ten
men
and
he
gave
me
this
she
shows
Merida
a
coin
bearing
the
symbol
of
two
crossed
axes
For
a
spell
A
spell
that
would
change
his
fate
Merida
And
did
he
get
what
he
was
after
The
Witch
Oh
Yes
And
made
off
with
an
especially
attractive
mahogany
cheese
board
the
witch
brews
up
a
potion
in
her
cauldron
The
Witch
Now
lets
see
What
have
we
here
the
witch
fishes
out
a
tart
from
the
potion
Merida
Uh
A
cake
The
Witch
You

want
it
Merida
Yes
I
want
it
Youre
sure
if
I
give
this
to
my
mum
It
will
change
my
fate
The
Witch
Oh

me
Itll
do
the
trick
dearie
as
Merida
walks
out
of
the
cottage
Expect
delivery
of
your
purchase
within
a
fortnight
to
herself
as
Merida
walks
off
Oh
Oh
What
was
that
thing
about
the
spell
Merida
Did
you
say
something
About
The
spell
as
Merida
turns
to
face
the
witch
she
sees
the
cottage
and
the
witch
have
disappeared
as
Merida
returns
to
the
castle
she
prepares
a
tea
tray
for
her
mother
and
places
the
tart
on
the
tray
Elinor
Merida
Merida
Mum

Merida
You

I
didnt

what
to

of
Oh

dress
Merida
Oh

But

Elinor
Well

of
it
Merida
Honestly
Elinor
Ive

the
lords
for
now
Youre
fathers

there
entertaining
them
Elinor
smiles
Of
course
we
both
know
a
decision
still
has
to
be
made
Merida
gives
her
mother
an
angry
look
turns
and
picks
up
the
plate
of
tart
Whats

Merida
Its
a
peace
offering
I
made
it
for
you
Elinor
takes
the
plate
of
tart
Elinor
You

this
for
me
she
takes
a
bite
of
the
tart
Mm
Elinors
face
suddenly
screws
up
Merida
How
do
you
feel
Elinor
WhatWhat

that
Merida
Different
Elinor
Tart
and
um
Gamy
Elinor
starts
to
feel
sick
and
puts
the
plate
of
tart
down
Merida
Have
you
changed
your
mind
at
all
about
the
marriage
and
all
that
Elinor
takes
a
drink
and
gargles
it
in
her
mouth
to
get
rid
of
the
taste
of
the
tart
Elinor
Now
why
dont
we
go
upstairs
to
the
lords
and
put
this
whole
kerfuffle
to
rest
she
takes
Merida
out
of
the
kitchen
as
they
walk
towards
the
hall
Elinor
suddenly
starts
to
feel
sick
Oh
Merida
Mother
Elinor
Im
woozy
suddenly
Oh
my
heads
spinning
like
a
top
Merida
catches
Elinor
as
shes
about
to
fall
Merida
Mum
Elinor
Oh
Suddenly
Im
not
well
Merida
Uh
How
do
you
feel
about
the
marriageNow
Elinor
Merida
Ah
Will

take
me
to
my
room
Lord
MacGuffin
Queen
Weve
been
waiting
patiently
Elinor
My
lords
I
am
out
of
sorts
at
the
moment
But
you
shall
have
your
answer
suddenly
Elinor
does
a
massive
burp
Presently
Now
if
youll
excuse
us
as
Merida
helps
her
mom
get
into
bed
Merida
Just
take
all
the
time
you
need
to
get
yourself
right
mama
And
maybe
in
a
bit
you
might
have
something
new
to
say
on
the
marriage
Elinor
What
was
in
that
cake
Merida
Cake
Suddenly
Elinor
rolls
of
the
bed
in
pain
Mum
So
I
I'll
just
tell
them
the
wedding's
off
then
Merida
hears
a
growling
noise
from
where
Elinor
rolled
of
down
the
bed
Merida
Mum
Merida
walks
round
to
see
if
Elinor
is
fine
she
sees
a
giant
shape
rise
from
the
floor
as
it
turns
we
see
Elinor
has
transformed
into
a
bear
making
Merida
scream
with
terror
Merida
BEAR
Elinor
starts
freaking
out
tearing
up
the
room
After
Elinor
has
transformed
to
a
bear
Merida
Mum
You're
You're
a
bear
Why
a
bear
Oh
that
scatty
witch
gave
me
a
gammy
spell
Elinor
now
unable
to
speak
gives
Merida
a
shocked
look
at
her
revelation
It's
not
my
fault
I
didn't
ask
her
to
change
you
into
a
bear
I
just
wanted
her
to
change
You
Realizing
what
Merida
has
done
Elinor
growls
at
Merida
in
anger
Did
you
hear
that
Elinor
paces
around
growls
in
frustration
as
if
telling
Merida
off
Merida
There's
no
point
in
having
ago
at
me
The
witch
is
to
blame
Googly
old
hag
Elinor
finds
her
crown
puts
it
on
Eyes
all
over
the
place
Unbelievable
I'll
get
her
to
fix
this
Everybody
follow
me
And
keep
a
sharp
eye
Here
we
go
Another
hunt
through
the
castle
But
we
haven't
had
desert
yet
I
have
no
idea
Merida
as
Elinor
decides
to
leave
her
room
Mum
you
can't
go
out
there
Mum
What
are
you
doing
Merida
tries
to
stop
her
mom
from
leaving
Dad
The
Bear
King
If
he
so
much
as
he
sees
you
youre
dead
Suddenly
Merida
hears
Fergus
who's
heard
the
commotion
and
is
heading
towards
them
followed
by
the
lords
Another
one
of
those
entertainments
to
bore
us
to
the
death
Oh
and
what
exactly
are
we
after
Merida
Elinor
heads
the
other
way
and
Merida
follows
her
Mum
My
legs
Best
of
humor
him
He
is
after
all
the
King
He's
like
a
hound
with
that
nose
of
his
Merida
Mom
wait
We
have
to
Follow
me
Trying
to
stop
Elinor
from
sneaking
out
Merida
snatches
off
Elinor's
bed
sheet
that
she's
wrapped
around
herself
STOP
Elinor
feeling
embarrassed
tries
to
cover
herself
You're
covered
with
FUR
You're
not
naked
It's
not
like
anyone's
gonna
see
you
At
that
moment
they
see
the
triplet's
nanny
standing
in
the
hallway
looking
at
them
in
shock
Elinor
waves
at
her
and
she
screams
and
runs
off
Merida
Now
youve
done
it
Maudie
Just
calm
down
lass
What
is
it
Spit
it
out
Maudie
A
BEAR
I
knew
it
Merida
would
you
just
listen
to
me
We
can't
go
this
way
You'll
be
seen
Quick
This
way
Mom
After
Elinor
tries
to
get
away
from
Fergus
hunting
her
down
she
stumbles
into
a
room
to
hide
but
finds
the
triplets
playing
Merida
Mum
Merida
A
witch
turned
mum
into
a
bear
It's
NOT
my
fault
We've
got
to
get
out
of
the
castle
I
need
your
help
The
triplets
cross
their
arms
stare
at
her
Oh
alright
You
can
have
my
deserts
for
two
THREE
weeks
The
triplet
in
the
middle
indicates
with
his
hand
that
Merida
needs
to
increase
the
offer
Okay
fine
A
year
Did
you
hear
that
There
it
goes
Come
on
lads
There
it
goes
Merida
Come
on
mum
Think
we
should
lay
a
trap
Try
shutting
yours
There
he
is
I'm
sure
it
went
this
way
You
can
see
my
house
from
here
It
must
have
sprouted
wings
Was
carried
away
by
a
giant
birdy
A
dragon
perhaps
Bear
in
the
castle
Doesn't
make
sense
it
cannot
open
doors
He's
got
giant
paws
Let's
just
get
inside
It's
locked
Dingwall
was
the
last
up
I
propped
it
open
with
a
stick
What
did
you
see
Maudie
Just
spit
it
out
Maudie
Oh
for
goodness
sake
Maudie
Would
you
get
a
grip
Maudie
honey
come
here
It's
alright
Merida
Come
on
Mum
Quick
Elinor
turns
and
gives
a
worrying
look
towards
the
triplets
Merida
They'll
be
fine
Won't
you
boys
Mum
we've
got
to
hurry
Merida
pushes
her
mom
out
the
door
turns
to
the
triplets
Now
I'll
be
back
soon
Go
on
and
help
yourself
to
anything
you
want
as
a
reward
Merida
closes
the
door
the
triplets
turn
see
the
half
eaten
witch's
tart
and
head
towards
it
Right
After
leaving
the
castle
Merida
and
her
mother
head
out
to
the
forest
Merida
Where
are
these
wisps
Come
out
wisps
Come
on
out
Lead
me
to
the
witch's
cottage
I'm
here
Fine
don't
come
out
now
that
my
mum's
watching
Elinor
looks
at
Merida
questioningly
Merida
I
was
standing
right
here
and
the
wisp
appeared
right
there
Then
a
whole
trail
of
them
led
me
off
into
the
forest
Elinor
starts
walking
off
into
the
forest
Merida
Does
she
think
that
I
just
happened
upon
a
witch's
cottage
After
walking
a
while
in
the
forest
Merida
suddenly
stops
looks
around
her
Oh
mum
I
know
this
place
The
witchs
cottage
It's
this
way
Come
on
Hurry
Merida
starts
running
ahead
and
finds
the
witchs
cottage
I
cant
believe
it
I
found
it
she
opens
the
cottage
door
but
finds
it
completely
empty
No
She
was
here
No
really
She
was
just
here
Oh
wait
No
she
keeps
shutting
and
opening
the
cottage
door
No
No
No
No
in
the
witchs
cottage
Merida
accidentally
sets
off
a
Rube
Goldberg
machine
which
brings
up
the
witchs
cauldron
with
a
ghostly
image
of
the
witch
appearing
above
it
Welcome
to
the
Crafty
Carver
home
of
bear
themed
carvings
and
novelties
I
am
completely
out
of
stock
at
this
time
But
if
you
like
to
enquire
about
portraits
or
wedding
cake
toppers
pour
vial
one
into
the
Cauldon
If
you

the
menu
in
Gaelic
vial
two
If
you're

red
haired
lass
vial
three
To
speak
with
a
live
homonculus
Princess
I'm
off
to
the
wickerman
Festival
in
Stormoway
I
won't
be
back
till
spring
There's
one
bit
I
forgot
to
tell
you
about
the
spell
By
the
second
sunrise
your
spell
will
be
permanent
unless
you
remember
these
words
Fate
be
changed
look
inside
mend
the
bond
torn
by
pride
Merida
Fate
be
changed
Mend
the
bond
What
does
that
mean
One
more
time
Fate
be
changed
look
inside
mend
the
bond
torn
by
pride
That's
it
Tata
oh
and
thank
you
for
chopping
at
the
Crafy
Carver
Merida
No
No
Where
did
you
go
Suddenly
the
witchs
ghostly
image
appears
again
and
starts
giving
the
same
message
Merida
starts
pouring
in
all
the
vials
into
the
cauldron
in
panic
Merida
Maybe
there's
a
book
of
spells
Look
around
We'll
need
more
vials
She
accidently
blows
the
cauldron
and
the
cottage
disappears
After
the
witchs
cottage
disappears
it
starts
to
rain
Merida
builds
a
shelter
for
Elinor
and
turns
to
her
Merida
Well
sort
it
out
tomorrow
as
they
sleep
Merida
has
flashback
to
when
she
was
little
and
was
afraid
of
thunder
her
mother
would
hold
and
comfort
her
Merida
UhGood
morning
So
whats
all
this
supposed
to
be
Elinor
growls
trying
to
communicate
Merida
Sorry
I
dont
speak
bear
Elinor
mimes
that
Merida
should
remover
her
bow
from
the
table
Oh
Merida
removes
her
bow
and
Elinor
starts
eating
the
berries
shes
gathered
for
breakfast
Find
those
by
the
creek
did
you
Theyre
Nightshade
berries
Theyre
poisonous
suddenly
Elinor
spits
out
the
berries
shed
just
put
in
her
mouth
and
in
panic
drinks
some
water
Merida
Where
did
you
get
this
water
It
has
worms
Elinor
quickly
spits
out
the
water
she
was
drinking
and
sits
in
defeat
Merida
smiles
and
gets
up
Merida
Come
on
Merida
and
Elinor
head
to
a
creek
and
Merida
uses
her
bow
to
catch
a
fish
Merida
Oh
wait
A
princess
should
not
have
weapons
in
your
opinion
Elinor
nods
in
agreement
and
Merida
holds
the
fish
out
for
Elinor
MErida
There
you
go
Go
on
the
fish
flaps
as
its
still
alive
and
Elinor
turns
away
in
disgust
Merida
How
do
you
know
you
dont
like
it
if
you
wont
try
it
Merida
then
cooks
the
fish
over
a
fire
and
Elinor
tries
to
eat
with
decorum
but
quickly
chomps
it
down
as
Elinor
is
still
hungry
Merida
then
teaches
Elinor
how
to
catch
fish
from
the
creek
and
they
start
bonding
After
bonding
over
catching
fish
Elinor
walks
off
into
the
forest
Merida
Mum
come
back
Elinor
turns
and
starts
to
act
more
like
a
bear
Merida
Mum
is
that
you
Elinor
growls
and
goes
to
attack
Merida
but
suddenly
stops
as
she
remembers
who
she
is
Merida
Mum
You
changed
Like
you
were
aI
mean
like
you
were
a
bear
on
the
inside
Merida
A
wisp
suddenly
they
notice
a
wisp
and
Elinor
jumps
to
get
hold
of
it
Merida
Mum
Stop
it
Mum
no
Merida
Jings
crivens
help
ma
boab
Mum
I
know
you're
scared
you're
tired
you
don't
understand
but
we've
got
to
keep
our
heads
Just
calm
down
Listen
They'll
show
us
the
way
after
following
the
the
trail
of
wisps
which
leads
them
to
the
ruins
of
a
castle
that
bears
the
symbol
of
the
crossed
axes
Merida
Mum
look
Why
did
the
wisps
bring
us
here
they
walk
around
the
ruins
Whoever
they
were
theyve
been
gone
for
a
long
long
timsuddenly
Merida
falls
through
the
floor
and
after
landing
she
shouts
to
Elinor
Im
fine
mum
Just
fine
Merida
Its
a
throne
room
Do
you
suppose
this
could
have
been
the
kingdom
in
that
story
you
were
telling
me
Elinor
roars
The
one
with
the
princes
Merida
sees
a
stone
with
three
figures
and
a
split
stone
with
the
fourth
figure
Merida
One
two
three
four
The
oldest
Likelike
the
tapestry
The
spell
Its
happened
before
Merida
sees
bones
all
over
the
floor
and
she
remembers
what
the
witch
said
about
the
prince
The
flashback
of
how
Merida
sliced
the
tapestry
is
like
how
the
prince
sliced
off
the
statue
Merida
The
strength
of
ten
men
Fate
be
changed
Changed
with
fate
she
realizes
that
the
oneeyed
bear
is
actually
the
prince
transformed
Oh
no
The
prince
became
suddenly
she
sees
the
bear
come
up
behind
her
Mordu
the
bear
goes
to
attack
Merida
but
she
starts
shooting
arrows
at
it
and
it
starts
chasing
after
her
Elinor
then
helps
her
to
escape
and
they
make
a
run
for
it
Merida
Mum
we
need
to
get
back
to
the
castle
If
we
dont
hurry
youll
become
like
Mordu
A
bear
A
real
bear
Forever
Mend
the
bond
torn
by
pride
The
witch
gave
us
the
answer
The
tapestry
Merida
and
Elinor
sneak
back
into
the
castle
and
as
they
peak
into
the
Great
Hall
Merida
Mum
do
you
have
a
better
idea
Merida
That'll
do
they
see
that
Fergus
and
the
lords
are
fighting
again
No
more
talk
No
more
traditions
We
settle
this
now
You're
the
king
You
decide
which
one
of
our
sons
your
daughter
will
marry
None
of
your
sons
are
fit
to
marry
my
daughter
Then
our
alliance
is
over
This
means
war
Merida
They're
gonna
murder
each
other
You've
got
to
stop
them
before
it's
too
late
The
bear
whines
Merida
I
know
I
know
But
how
do
we
get
you
through
there
and
up
to
the
tapestry
with
the
lot
of
them
boiling
over
like
that
Elinor
points
to
Merida
What
are
you
doing
lass
Merida
It's
alright
dad
I
um
I
have
Well
you
see
I
I
have
been
in
conference
with
the
Queen
Is
that
so
Merida
Aye
It
is
Well
where
is
she
then
How
do
we
know
that
this
isn't
some
trick
This
is
highly
irregular
What
are
you
playing
at
Where
is
the
Queen
We
will
not
stand
for
any
more
of
this
jiggery
pokery
That's
right
Let's
see
her
Merida
SHUT
IT
Well
I
She
looks
to
see
Elinor
in
the
background
Merida
Once
there
was
an
ancient
kingdom
What
is
this
Merida
That
kingdom
well
into
war
and
chaos
and
ruin
We've
heard
that
tale
Lost
kingdom
Merida
Aye
but
it's
true
I
know
how
one
selfish
act
can
turn
the
fate
of
a
kingdom
It's
just
a
legend
Legends
are
lessons
They
ring
with
truths
Our
kingdom
is
young
Our
stories
are
not
yet
legend
But
in
them
our
bond
was
struck
Our
clans
were
one
enemies
But
when
invaders
threatened
us
from
the
sea
you
joined
together
to
defend
our
lands
You
fought
for
each
other
You
risk
everything
for
each
other
Lord
MacGuffin
my
dad
saved
your
life
stopping
an
arrow
as
you
ran
to
Dingwall's
aid
Aye
and
I'll
never
forget
it
Merida
And
Lord
Macintosh
you
saved
my
dad
when
you
charged
in
on
heavy
horse
and
held
off
the
advance
And
we
all
know
how
Lord
Dingwall
broke
the
enemy
line
With
a
mighty
throw
of
his
spear
I
was
aiming
at
you
you
big
turnshie
Merida
The
story
of
this
kingdom
is
a
powerful
one
My
dad
railed
your
forces
and
you
made
him
your
king
It
was
an
alliance
forged
in
bravery
and
friendship
and
it
lives
to
this
day
Ive
been
selfish
I
tore
a
great
rift
in
our
kingdom
Theres
no
one
to
blame
but
me
And
I
know
now
that
I
need
to
amend
my
mistake
and
mend
our
bond
And
so
there
is
the
matter
of
my
betrothal
I
decided
to
do
whats
right
and
as
she
looks
around
the
room
she
notices
Elinor
in
the
background
trying
to
stop
her
AndAnd
breakTradition
she
looks
over
at
Elinor
who
is
miming
what
Merida
should
say
My
mother
the
queen
feelsUh
in
her
heart
that
IThat
we
be
free
toWrite
our
own
story
Follow
our
hearts
and
find
love
in
our
time
we
see
the
lords
are
all
now
crying
Lord
Dingwall
Beautiful
Merida
The
queen
and
I
put
the
decision
to
you
my
lords
Might
our
young
people
decide
for
themselves
who
they
will
love
Lord
Dingwall
Huh
Lord
Macintosh
Well
since
youve
obviously
made
up
your
minds
about
this
I
have
one
thing
to
say
This
is
Young
Macintosh
A
grand
idea
Give
us
our
own
say
in
choosing
our
fates
Lord
Macintosh
What
Young
Dingwall
Aye
Why
shouldnt
we
choose
Lord
Dingwall
But
shes
the
princess
Young
Dingwall
I
didnt
pick
her
out
It
was
your
idea
MacGuffin
turns
to
his
son
Lord
MacGuffin
And
you
do
you
feel
the
same
way
Young
MacGuffin
It's
jist
nae
fair
makin
us
ficht
for
the
hand
o
the
quine
that
disnae

any
bit
o
it
Ken
Merida
giggles
Lord
MacGuffin
Well
thats
it
Let
these
lads
try
win
her
heart
before
they
win
her
hand
if
they
can
Lord
Dingwall
I
say
the
wee
Dingwall
has
a
fighting
chance
Lord
Macintosh
Fine
then
Seems
for
once
we
agree
It
was
my
idea
in
the
first
place
Bowing
Merida
turns
to
her
dad
Fergus
Just
like
your
mum
you
devil
Merida
turns
and
notices
a
guard
staring
at
Elinors
frozen
pose
as
a
stuffed

and
tries
to
distract
everyone
Merida
EVERYONE

Merida
The

Fergus
tuns
to
one
his
servants
and
whispers
Bring
them
tiny
glasses
they
all
leave
the
Great
Hall
and
Merida
goes
to
Elinor
and
does
a
little
dance
of
joy
before
realizing
they
have
to
mend
the
tapestry
Merida
The

Merida
touches
the
tear
in
her

the
three

Fergus
laughs
and
catches
one
of
them
holding
him
up
Fergus
Now

what
I
call
a
wee
naked
baby
Merida
voice
over
Some
say
fate
is
beyond
our
command
but
I
know
better
Our
fate
lives
within
us
You
just
have
to
be
brave
enough
to
see
it
we
see
Merida
rides
off
through
the
forest
with
her
Elinor
making
their
bond
stronger
after
credits
scene
the
guard
in
front
of
the
castle
is
awakened
by
the
witchs
crow
The
Crow
Delivery
Sign
here
sign
here
a
scroll
and
feather
hover
in
front
of
the
crow
then
we
see
the
whole
of
the
witchs
massive
collection
of
bear
sculptures
which
Merida
had
bought
earlier
behind
the
crow
Come
on
Birdbrain
I
havent
got
all
day
in
shock
the
guard
just
drops
his
spear
End
of
Brave
Tala
In
the
beginning
there
was
only
ocean
until
the
mother
island
emerged
Te
Fiti
Her
heart
held
the
greatest
power
ever
known
It
could
create
life
itself
And
Te
Fiti
shared
it
with
the
world
But
in
time
some
begin
to
seek
Te
Fiti's
heart
They
believed
that
they
could
possess
it
the
great
power
of
creation
would
be
theirs
And
one
day
the
most
daring
of
them
all
voyaged
across
the
vast
ocean
to
take
it
He
was
a
Demigod
of
the
wind
and
sea
He
was
a
warrior
A
trickster
A
shapeshifter
who
could
change
form
with
the
power
of
his
magical
fish
hook
And
his
name
was
Maui
But
without
her
heart
Te
Fiti
began
to
crumble
giving
birth
to
a
terrible
darkness
Maui
tried
to
escape
but
was
confronted
by
another
who
sought
the
heart
Te
Ka
a
demon
of
earth
and
fire
Maui
was
struck
from
the
sky
never
to
be
seen
again
And
his
magical
fish
hook
and
the
heart
of
Te
Fiti
were
lost
to
the
sea
Where
even
now
years
later
Te
Ka
and
the
demons
of
the
deep
still
hunt
for
the
heart
hiding
in
the
darkness
that
will
continue
to
spread
chasing
away
our
fish
draining
the
life
from
island
after
island
until
every
one
of
us
is
devoured
by
the
bloodthirsty
jaws
of
INESCAPABLE
DEATH
But
one
day
the
heart
will
be
found
by
someone
who
would
journey
beyond
the
reef
find
Maui
deliver
him
across
the
great
ocean
to
restore
Te
Fiti's
heart
and
save
us
all
Tui
Thank
you
Mother
that's
enough
Moana
Papa
Chief
Tui
No
one
goes
outside
the
reef
We're
safe
here
There
is
no
darkness
There
are
no
monsters
Children
screaming
Chief
Tui
There
is
nothing
beyond
that
reef
but
storm
and
rough
sea
As
long
as
we
stay
on
our
very
safe
island
we'll
be
fine
Gramma
Tala
The
legends
are
true
Someone
will
have
to
go
Chief
Tui
Mother
Motunui
is
paradise
Who
would
want
to
go
anywhere
else
Chief
Tui
Moana
Oh

Let's
go

to
the
village
You

the
next
great
chief
of
our
people
Sina
And
you'll
do
wondrous
things
my
little
minnow
Chief
Tui
Oh

you
must
learn
where
you're
meant
to
be
Chief
Tui
Moana
make
way
make
way
Moana
it's
time
you
knew
The
village
of
Motunui
is
all
you
need
The
dancers
are
practicing
They
dance
to
an
ancient
song
Who
needs
a
new
song
This
old
one's
all
we
need
This
tradition
is
our
mission
And
Moana
there's
so
much
to
do
Make
way
Don't
trip
on
the
taro
root
that's
all
you
need
We
share
everything
we
make
We
make
We
joke
and
we
weave
our
baskets
Aha
The
fishermen
come
back
from
the
sea
Moana
I
wanna
see
Chief
Tui
Don't
walk
away
Moana
stay
on
the
ground
now
Our
people
will
need
a
chief
and
there
you
are
Chief
Tui
and
Sina
There
comes
a
day
When
you're
gonna
look
around
And
realize
happiness
is
where
you
are
Chief
Tui
Consider
the
coconut
the
what
Consider
its
tree
We
use
each
part
of
the
coconut
that's
all
we
need
Sina
We
make
our
nets
from
the
fibers
The
water's
sweet
inside
We
use
the
leaves
to
build
fires
We
cook
up
the
meat
inside
Chief
Tui
Consider
the
coconuts
The
trunks
and
the
leaves
The
island
gives
us
what
we
need
Moana
And
no
one
leaves
Chief
Tui
That's
right
we
stay
We're
safe
and
we're
well
provided
And
when
we
look
to
the
future
There
you
are
You'll
be
okay
In
time
you'll
learn
just
as
I
did
Chief
Tui
and
Sina
You
must
find
happiness
right
where
you
are
Gramma
Tala
I
like
to
dance
with
the
water
The
undertow
and
the
waves
The
water
is
mischievous
ha
I
like
how
it
misbehaves
The
village
may
think
I'm
crazy
Or
say
that
I
drift
too
far
But
once
you
know
what
you
like
well
there
you
are
You
are
your
father's
daughter
Stubbornness
and
pride
Mind
what
he
says
but
remember
You
may
hear
a
voice
inside
And
if
the
voice
starts
to
whisper
To
follow
the
farthest
star
Moana
that
voice
inside
is
who
you
are
Moana
Dad
I
was
only
looking
at
the
boats
I
wasn't
gonna
get
on
them
Chief
Tui
Come
on
There's
something
I
need
to
show
you
I've
wanted
to
bring
you
here
from
the
moment
you
opened
your
eyes
This
is
a
sacred
place
The
place
of
chiefs
There
will
come
a
time
when
you
will
stand
on
this
peak
and
place
a
stone
on
this
mountain
Like
I
did
Like
my
father
did
And
his
father
and
every
chief
there
has
ever
been
And
on
that
day
when
you
place
your
stone
you
will
raise
this
whole
island
higher
You
are
the
future
of
our
people
Moana
They
are
not
out
there
They
are
right
here
It's
time
to
be
who
they
need
you
to
be
Villagers
We
make
our
nets
from
the
fibers
We
weave
our
nets
from
the
fibers
The
water's
sweet
inside
And
we'll
taste
the
sweet
inside
We
use
the
leaves
to
build
fires
We
sing
these
songs
in
our
choir
We
cook
up
the
meat
inside
beat
inside
Chief
Tui
The
village
believes
in
us
Ha
That's
right
The
village
believes
Ha
The
island
gives
us
what
we
need
And
no
one
leaves
Moana
So
here
I'll
stay
My
home
my
people
beside
me
And
when
I
think
of
tomorrow
Villagers
There
we
are
Moana
I'll
lead
the
way
I'll
have
my
people
to
guide
me
We'll
build
our
future
together
Villagers
Where
we
are
Moana
'Cause
every
path
leads
you
back
to
Villagers
Where
you
are
Moana
You
can
find
happiness
right
Villagers
Where
you
are
Where
you
are
Villager
Every
storm
this
roof
leaks
no
matter
how
many
fronds
I
add
MoanaFixed
Not
the
fronds
Wind
shifted
the
post
Mmm
That's
good
pork
Oh
I
mean
No
I
wasn't
What
They're
calling
me
so
I
gotta
Bye
Moana
You're
doing
great
Villager
Is
he
done
yet
Moana
So
close
Villager
I'm
curious
about
that
chicken
eating
the
rock
He
seems
to
lack
the
basic
intelligence
required
for
pretty
much
everything
Should
we
maybe
just
cook
him
Moana
Sometimes
our
strength
lies
beneath
the
surface
Far
beneath
in
some
cases
But
I'm
sure
there's
more
to
Heihei
than
meets
the
eye
Villager
It's
the
harvest
This
morning
I
was
husking
the
coconuts
and
Moana
Well
We
should
clear
the
diseased
trees
And
we
will
start
a
new
grove
there
Villager
Thanks
Moana
She's
doing
great
Chief
Tui
This
suits
you
Villager
Chief
There's
something
you
need
to
see
Our
traps
in
the
east
lagoon
They're
pulling
up
less
and
less
fish
Moana
Then
we'll
rotate
the
fishing
ground
Villager
We
have
there's
no
fish
Moana
Oh
Then
we'll
fish
far
side
of
the
island
Villager
We
tried
Moana
The
windward
side
Villager
And
the
leeward
side
The
shallows
the
channel
We
tried
the
whole
lagoon
They're
just
gone
Villagers
What
have
you
tried
using
for
the
bait
I
don't
use
it
as
a
bait
Chief
Tui
I
will
talk
to
the
council
I'm
sure
we'll
Moana
What
if
we
fished
beyond
the
reef
Chief
Tui
No
one
goes
beyond
the
reef
Moana
I
know
But
if
there
are
no
fish
in
the
lagoon
Chief
Tui
Moana
Moana
And
there's
a
whole
ocean
Chief
Tui
We
have
one
rule
Moana
An
old
rule
when
there
were
fish
Chief
Tui
A
rule
that
keeps
us
safe
Moana
But
Dad
Chief
Tui
Instead
of
endangering
our
people
so
you
can
run
right
back
to
the
water
Every
time
I
think
you're
past
this
No
one
goes
beyond
the
reef
Sina
Well
it's
not
like
you
said
it
in
front
of
your
dad
standing
on
a
boat
Moana
I
didn't
say
go
beyond
the
reef
because
I
want
to
be
on
the
ocean
Sina
But
you
still
do
He's
hard
on
you
because
Moana
Because
he
doesn't
get
me
Sina
Because
he
was
you
Drawn
to
the
ocean
Down
by
the
shore
He
took
a
canoe
Moana
He
crossed
the
reef
and
found
an
unforgiving
sea
Waves
like
mountains
His
best
friend
begged
to
be
on
that
boat
He
couldn't
save
him
He's
hoping
he
can
save
you
Sometimes
who
we
wish
we
were
what
we
wish
we
can
do
is
just
not
meant
to
be
Moana
I've
been
staring
at
the
edge
of
the
water
Long
as
I
can
remember
never
really
knowing
why
I
wish
I
could
be
the
perfect
daughter
But
I
come
back
to
the
water
no
matter
how
hard
I
try
Every
turn
I
take
every
trail
I
track
Every
path
I
make
every
road
leads
back
To
the
place
I
know
where
I
can
not
go
where
I
long
to
be
See
the
line
where
the
sky
meets
the
sea
It
calls
me
And
no
one
knows
how
far
it
goes
If
the
wind
in
my
sail
on
the
sea
stays
behind
me
One
day
I'll
know
if
I
go
there's
just
no
telling
how
far
I'll
go
I
know
everybody
on
this
island
seems
so
happy
on
this
island
Everything
is
by
design
I
know
everybody
on
this
island
has
a
role
on
this
island
So
maybe
I
can
roll
with
mine
I
can
lead
with
pride
I
can
make
us
strong
I'll
be
satisfied
if
I
play
along
But
the
voice
inside
sings
a
different
song
What
is
wrong
with
me
See
the
light
as
it
shines
on
the
sea
It's
blinding
But
no
one
knows
how
deep
it
goes
And
it
seems
like
it's
calling
out
to
me
so
come
find
me
And
let
me
know
what's
beyond
that
line
will
I
cross
that
line
See
the
line
where
the
sky
meets
the
sea
It
calls
me
And
no
one
knows
how
far
it
goes
If
the
wind
in
my
sail
on
the
sea
stays
behind
me
One
day
I'll
know
how
far
I'll
go
Moana
I
can
do
this
There's
more
fish
beyond
the
reef
There's
more
beyond
the
reef
Not
so
bad
Pua
Gasping
for

Gramma

Whatever
just
happened
blame
it
on
the
pig
Moana
Grandma
Are
you
gonna
tell
dad
Gramma
Tala
I'm
his
mom
I
don't
have
to
tell
him
anything
Moana
He
was
right
About
going
out
there
It's
time
to
put
my
stone
on
the
mountain
Gramma
Tala
Okay
Well
then
head
on
back
Put
that
stone
up
there
Moana
Why
aren't
you
trying
to
talk
me
out
of
it
Gramma
Tala
You
said
that's
what
you
wanted
Moana
It
is
Gramma
Tala
When
I
die
I'm
going
to
come
back
as
one
of
these
Or
I
chose
the
wrong
tattoo
Moana
Why
are
you
acting
weird
Gramma
Tala
I'm
the
village
crazy
lady
That's
my
job
Moana
If
there's
something
you
want
to
tell
me
just
tell
me
Is
there
something
you
want
to
tell
me
Gramma
Tala
Is
there
something
you
want
to
hear
You've
been
told
all
our
people's
stories
but
one
Moana
What
is
this
place
Gramma
Tala
Do
you
really
think
our
ancestors
stayed
within
the
reef
Moana
What's
in
there
Gramma
Tala
The
answer
to
the
question
you
keep
asking
yourself
Who
are
you
meant
to
be
Go
inside
bang

and
find

Maui
When
he

from

Island
darkness
fell
Te

Monsters
lurked
and
boats
stopped
coming
back
To
protect
our
people
the
ancient

forbid
voyaging
And
now
we
have
forgotten
who
we
are
And
the

has
continue
to
spread
chasing
away
our

draining
the

from

Our
island
Gramma

But
one

someone
will
journey

find
Maui
deliver
him
across
the
great
ocean
to
restore
the
heart
of

I
was
there
that
day
The
ocean
chose
you
Moana
I
thought
it
was
a
dream
Gramma

Nope
Our
ancestors
believed
Maui
lies
there
at
the
bottom
of
his
hook
Follow
it
and
you
will
find
him
Moana
But
Why'd
it
choose
me
I
don't
even
know
how
to
make
it
past
the

But
I
know
who
does
Villagers
The

are
turning

What
about

It
happens
all
over
the

Chief

Please

Settle
down

What
are
you
going

do
Who
will
dig
new

Chief

We'll
find
a
way
We
Moana
Can
stop

Save
our

This

Huge

We
can
take

Make
him
restore

We
were

We

You
told

to

This
is
how
we
can
help
our
people

What
are
you
doing
Chief

I
should've
burned

when

you
grab
him
by
the
ear
You
say
I

You
will
board

you
Go
Moana
There's
a
line
where
the
sky
meets
the
sea
and
it
calls
me
But
no
one
knows
how
far
it
goes
All
the
time
wondering
where
I
need
to
be
is
behind
me
I'm
on
my
own
to
worlds
unknown
Every
turn
I
take
every
trail
I
track
Is
a
choice
I
make
now
I
can't
turn
back
From
the
great
unknown
where
I
go
alone
where
I
long
to
be
See
her
light
up
the
night
in
the
sea
she
calls
me
And
yes
I
know
that
I
can
go
There's
a
moon
in
the
sky
and
the
wind
is
behind
me
Soon
I'll
know
how
far
I'll
go

No
I
came
here
to
Maui
Oh
of
course
of
course
Yes
yes
yes
yes
Maui
always
has
time
for
his
fans
When
you
use
a
bird
to
write
with
it's
called
tweeting
laughs
I
know
not
every
day
you
get
a
chance
to
meet
your
hero
Moana
You
are
not
my
hero
And
I'm
not
here
so
you
can
sign
my
oar
I'm
here
because
you
stole
the
heart
of
Te
Fiti
and
you
will
board
my
boat
sail
across
the
sea
and
put
it
back
Maui
Yeah
It
almost
sounds
like
you
don't
like
me
which
is
impossible
because
I
got
stuck
here
for
a
thousand
years
trying
to
get
the
heart
as
a
gift
for
you
mortals
so
you
could
have
the
power
to
create
life
itself
Yeah
So
what
I
believe
you
were
trying
to
say
is
thank
you
Moana
Thank
you
Maui
You're
welcome
Moana
Wait
no
no
no
II
didn't
I
wasn't
why
would
I
ever
say
Maui
Okay
okay
I
see
what's
happening
here
You're
facetoface
with
greatness
and
it's
strange
You
don't
even
know
how
you
feel
It's
adorable
Well
it's
nice
to
see
that
humans
never
change
Open
your
eyes
let's
begin
Yes
it's
really
me
It's
Maui
Breathe
it
in
I
know
it's
a
lot
the
hair
the
bod
When
you're
staring
at
a
demigod
What
can
I
say
except
You're
welcome
For
the
tides
the
sun
the
sky
Hey
it's
okay
it's
okay
you're
welcome
I'm
just
an
ordinary
demiguy
Hey
what
has
two
thumbs
and
pulled
up
the
sky
while
you
were
waddling
yay
high
This
guy
When
the
nights
got
cold
who
stole
you
fire
from
down
below
You're
looking
at
him
yo
Oh
also
I
lassoed
the
sun
You're
welcome
To
stretch
your
days
and
bring
you
fun
Also
I
harnessed
the
breeze
You're
welcome
To
fill
your
sails
and
shake
your
trees
So
what
can
I
say
except
you're
welcome
For
the
islands
I
pulled
from
the
sea
There's
no
need
to
pray
it's
okay
you're
welcome
I
guess
it's
just
my
way
of
being
me
You're
welcome
you're
welcome
Well
come
to
think
of
it
Kid
honestly
I
can
go
on
and
on
I
can
explain
every
natural
phenomenon
The
tide
the
grass
the
ground
Oh
that
was
Maui
just
messing
around
I
killed
an
eel
I
buried
its
guts
Sprouted
a
tree
now
you've
got
coconuts
What's
the
lesson
What
is
the
takeaway
Don't
mess
with
Maui
when
he's
on
the
breakaway
And
the
tapestry
here
on
my
skin
Is
a
map
of
the
victories
I
win
Look
where
I've
been
I
make
everything
happen
Look
at
that
mean
mini
Maui
just
tippity
tappin'
Well
anyway
let
me
say
you're
welcome
For
the
wonderful
world
you
know
Hey
it's
okay
it's
okay
you're
welcome
Well
come
to
think
of
it
I
gotta
go
Hey
it's
your
day
to
say
you're
welcome
'Cause
I'm
gonna
need
that
boat
I'm
sailing
away
away
you're
welcome
'Cause
Maui
can
do
anything
but
float
You're
welcome
you're
welcome
And
thank
you
Moana
Hey
let
me
out
You
lying
slimy
son
of
a
Maui
Mm

Te
Fiti

mine
Okay

back
Boat

filthy
file
of
pebbles
Oh

Don't

It's
a
beautiful
cave

gonna
love
it
And
I'm
going
to
love
you
In
my
belly
Now

fatten
you

that
all

or

sleeping
in
my
armpit
You

That

heart
It
is
a
curse
The
second
I
took
it
I
got
blasted
out
of
the
sky
And
I
lost
my
hook
Get

Smoten
Listen

thing
doesn't
give
you
power
to
create
life
It's
a
homing
beacon
of
death
If

don't
put
it
away
bad
things
will
come
for
it
Moana
Come

You

get
to
Te
Fiti
you
have
to
go
through
a
whole
ocean
of
bad
Not

Te
Ka
Lava
monster
Ever
defeat
a
lava
monster
Moana
No
Have
you
Maui
I'm

suicide
mission
with
some
mortal
You

the
heart
without

And

I'm

hook
End
of
discussion
Moana
You'll
be
a
hero
That's
what
you're
about
right
Maui
Little
girl
I
am
a
hero
Moana
Maybe
you
were
but
now
Now
you're
just
the
guy
who
stole
the
heart
of
Te
Fiti
The
guy
who
cursed
the
world
You're
no
one's
hero
Maui
Pfft
No
one
Moana
But
put
this
back
Save
the
world
You'd
be
everyone's
hero
Maui
Maui

You're

Not

your
hook
We

Wind
and
Sea
Hero

all
Maui
First

get
my
hook
Moana
Then
save
the
world
Deal
Maui
Deal
Worth
a
shot
Okay
we
go
east
to
the
Lair
of
Tamatoa
If
anyone
has
my
hook
it's
that
beadyeyed
bottomfeeder
Moana
Teach
me
to
sail
My
job
is
to
deliver
Maui
across
the
great
ocean
I
should
I
should
be
sailing
Maui
It's
called
wayfinding
Princess
It's
not
just
sails
and
knots
It's
seeing
where
you're
going
in
your
mind
Knowing
where
you
are
by
knowing
where
you've
been
Moana
Okay
first
I'm
not
a
princess
I'm
the
daughter
of
the
chief
Maui
Same
difference
Moana
No
Maui
If
you
wear
a
dress
and
you
have
an
animal
sidekick
you're
a
princess
You're
not
a
wayfinder
You'll
never
be
a
wayfinder
You
will
never
be
a
wayf
Really
Blowdart
in
my
buttcheek
You
are
a
bad
person
Moana
If
you
can
talk
you
can
teach
Wayfinding
Lesson
one
hit
it
Maui
Pull
the
sheets
Not
the
sheets
No
No
No
No
Tried
that
one
already
You're
measuring
the
stars
not
giving
the
sky
a
highfive
If
the
current's
warm
you're
going
the
right
way
Moana
It's
cold
Wait
it's
getting
warmer
Augh
that's
disgusting
What's
wrong
with
you
Black
cloud
We're
here
See
I
told
you
I
could
do
it
Motunui
I'm
home
Chief
Tui
Moana
Moana
Dad
Sina
Moana
Moana
Mom
Chief
Tui
Help
Moana
No
Chief
Tui
Moana
Maui
Enjoy
your
beauty
rest
You
know
a
real
wayfinder
never
sleeps
So
they
actually
get
where
they
need
to
go
Muscle
up
butter
cup
We're
here
Moana
You
sure
this
guy's
gonna
have
your
hook
Maui
Tamatoa
oh
he'll
have
it
He's
a
scavenger
Collects
stuff
things
that
looks
cool
And
for
Tamatoa
trust
me
my
hook
is
the
coolest
collectible
Moana
And
he
lives
up
there
Maui
Oh
ho
no
no
no
That's
just
the
entrance
to
Lalotai
Moana
Lalotai
Realm
of
Monsters
We're
going
to
the
Realm
of
Monsters
Maui
We
No
Me
You
are
gonna
stay
here
with
the
other
chicken
That's
what
I'm
talking
about
give
me
some
Come
on
that
was
a
good
one
how'd
you
not
get
it
I
called
her
chicken
there's
a
chicken
on
the
boat
I
know
she's
human
but
that's
not
You
know
forget
it
Forget
it
I'm
not
explaining
it
to
you
What
'Cause
then
it's
not
funny
So
Daughter
of
the
chief
I
thought
you
stayed
in
the
village
You
know
kissing
babies
and
things
Hey
I'm
just
trying
to
understand
why
your
people
decided
to
send
uh
How
do
I
phrase
this
You
Moana
My
people
didn't
send
me
The
ocean
did
Maui
The
ocean
Makes
sense
you're
what
eight
Can't
sail
Obvious
choice
Moana
It
chose
me
for
a
reason
Maui
If
the
ocean's
so
smart
why
didn't
it
just
take
the
heart
back
to
Te
Fiti
itself
Or
bring
me
my
hook
The
ocean
straight
up
pooky
dooks
But
I'm
sure
it's
not
wrong
about
you
You're
the
chosen
one
Moana
The
ocean
chose
you
for
a
reason
Maui
If
you
start
singing
I'm
gonna
throw
up
Moana
So
not
seeing
an
entrance
Maui
Yes
because
it
only
appears
after
a
human
sacrifice
Kidding
Ha
ha
ha
So
serious
Don't
worry
it's
a
lot
farther
down
than
it
looks
Cheehoo
I
am
still
falling
Moana
You
can
do
this
Go
Maui
And
he
sticks
the
landing
What
Dumbdumb
she's
not
even
here
No
mortal's
gonna
jump
into
the
realm
of
mon
Well
She's
dead
Okay
let's
get
my
hook
Moana
Maui's
fishhook
Maui
Yeah
Moana
Sorry
I
thought
you
were
a
monster
but
I
found
your
hook
and
you're
right
This
Tamatoa
really
likes
treasure
Maui
Stay
Moana
What
No
I'm
I'm
the
one
who
Maui
Listen
For
a
thousand
years
I've
only
been
thinking
about
keeping
this
hair
silky
getting
my
hook
and
being
awesome
again
And
it's
not
getting
screwed
up
by
a
mortal
Who
has
no
business
inside
of
a
monster
cave
except
ExceptMaybe
as
bait
Moana
sigh
Wow
the
shiny
glittering
cave
And
just
like
me
it's
covered
in
sparkling
treasure
Sparkle

Maui
You're

selling
it
MoanaThis
is
stupid
I'm
just
gonna
walk
up
there
Maui
whisper
You
go
out
there
he
will
kill
you
Just
stick
to
the
plan
Oh
When
he
shows
up
keep
him
distracted
Make
him
talk
about
himself
He
loves
bragging
about
how
awesome
he
is
Moana
Well

two
must
get
along
perfectly
MauiWell

since
I
ripped
his
leg

grandma
And

took
a
week
because
she
was
absolutely
humongous
Why

Moana
Cause

amazing
And
we
mortals
have
heardthe
tales
about
the
crabwho
became
a
legend
And
I
got
to
know
How
did
you
get
so
crabulous
Tamatoa
Are

trying
to
get
me

In

a
demigod
to
beat

decapod
Look

will
die

Now
it's
time
for
me
to
take
apart
Your

abandoned
you
Chasing
the
love
of
these
humans
Who
made
you
feel
wanted
You
try
to
be
tough
But
your
armor's
just
not
hard
enough
Maui
Now

time

me
what
it
is
Maui
I
said
back
off
Moana
Is
that
why
your
hook's
not
working
You
don't
wanna
talk
Don't
talk
You
wanna
throw
me
off
the
boat
Throw
me
off
You
wanna
tell
me
I
don't
know
what
I'm
doing
I
know
I
don't
I
have
no
idea
why
the
ocean
chose
me
You're
right
But
my
island
is
dying
So
I
am
here
It's
just
me
and
you
And
I
want
to
help
But
I
can't
if
you
don't
let
me
Maui
I
wasn't
born
a
demigod
I
had
human
parents
They
They
took
one
look
and
decided
they
did
not
want
me
They
threw
me
into
the
sea
like
I
was
nothing
Somehow
I
was
found
by
the
gods
They
gave
me
the
hook
They
made
me
Maui
And
back
to
the
humans
I
went
I
gave
them
islands
fire
coconuts
Anything
they
could
ever
want
Moana
You
took
the
heart
for
them
You
did
everything
for
them
So
they
would
love
you
Maui
It
was
never
enough
Moana
Maybe
the
gods
found
you
for
a
reason
Maybe
the
ocean
brought
you
to
them
because
it
saw
someone
who
was
worthy
of
being
saved
But
the
gods
aren't
the
ones
who
made
you
Maui
You
are
Maui
Okay
okay
I
I
love
you
too
buddy
Yeah
Next
stop
Te
Fiti
Moana
What
Maui
I
figured
it
out
You
know
the
ocean
used
to
love
when
I
pulled
up
islands
'Cause
your
ancestors
would
sail
the
seas
and
find
them
All
those
new
islands
new
villages
It
was
the
water
that
connected
them
all
And
if
I
were
the
ocean
I
think
I'd
be
looking
for
a
curly
haired
nonprincess
to
start
that
again
Moana
That
is
literally
the
nicest
thing
you've
ever
said
to
me
Probably
should've
saved
that
for
Te
Fiti
Maui
I
did
Moana
of
Motunui
I
believe
you
have
officially
delivered
Maui
across
the
great
sea
Moana
Moana
Moana
You're
so
amaziiiiing
Moana
It's
time
Go
save
the
world
Maui
Maui
What
What
are
you
doing
Moana
Finding
you
a
better
way
in
Maui
We
won't
make
it
Moana
Yes
we
will
Maui
Turn
around
Moana
No
Maui
Moana
stop
Moana
No
Are
you
okay
Maui
Maui
I
told
you
to
turn
back
Moana
I
thought
we
could
make
it
Maui
We
Moana
I
thought
I
could
make
it
We
can
fix
it
Maui
It
was
made
by
the
gods
You
can't
FIX
it
Moana
Next
time
we'll
be
more
careful
Te
Ka
was
stuck
on
the
barrier
island
It's
lava
It
can't
go
in
the
water
We
can
find
a
way
around
Maui
I'm
not
going
back
Moana
What
We
still
have
to
restore
the
heart
Maui
My
hook
is
cracked
One
more
hit
and
it's
over
Moana
Maui
you
have
to
restore
the
heart
Maui
Without
my
hook
I
am
nothing
Moana
That's
not
true
Maui
WITHOUT
MY
HOOK
I
AM
NOTHING
Moana
We
are
only
here
because
you
stole
the
heart
in
the
first
place
Maui
No
we're
here
because
the
ocean
told
you
you're
special
and
you
believed
it
Moana
I
am
Moana
of
Motunui
You
will
board
my
boat
Maui
Goodbye
Moana
Moana
Sail
across
the
sea
Maui
I'm
not
killing
myself
so
you
can
prove
you're
something
you're
not
Moana
I
must
restore
the
heart
of
Te
Fiti
The
ocean
chose
me
Maui
It
chose
wrong
Moana
Maui
Why
did
you
bring
me
here
I'm
not
the
right
person
You
have
to
choose
someone
else
Choose
someone
else
Please
Gramma
Tala
You
are
a
long
ways
past
the
reef
Moana
Grandma
Gramma
Tala
Guess
I
chose
the
right
tattoo
Moana
Grandma
I
tried
grandma
I
I
couldn't
do
it
Gramma
Tala
It's
not
your
fault
I
never
should
have
put
so
much
on
your
shoulders
If
you're
ready
to
go
home
I
will
be
with
you
Why
do
you
hesitate
Moana
I
don't
know
Gramma
Tala
I
know
a
girl
from
an
island
She
stands
apart
from
the
crowd
She
loves
the
sea
and
her
people
She
makes
her
whole
family
proud
Sometimes
the
world
seems
against
you
The
journey
may
leave
a
scar
But
scars
can
heal
and
reveal
just
where
you
are
The
people
you
love
will
change
you
The
things
you
have
learned
will
guide
you
And
nothing
on
earth
can
silence
the
quiet
voice
still
inside
you
And
when
that
voice
starts
to
whisper
Moana
you've
come
so
far
Moana
listen
Do
you
know
who
you
are
Moana
Who
am
I
I
am
a
girl
who
loves
my
island
I'm
a
girl
who
loves
the
sea
It
calls
me
I
am
the
daughter
of
the
village
chief
We
are
descended
from
voyagers
Who
found
their
way
across
the
world
They
call
me
I've
delivered
us
to
where
we
are
I
have
journeyed
farther
I
am
everything
I've
learned
and
more
Still
it
calls
me
And
the
call
isn't
out
there
at
all
It's
inside
me
It's
like
the
tide
always
falling
and
raising
I
will
carry
you
here
in
my
heart
You
remind
me
That
come
what
may
I
know
the
way
I
AM
MOANA
I
am
Moana
of
Motunui
Aboard
my
boat
I
will
sail
across
the
sea
and
restore
the
heart
of
Te
Fiti
The
follow
us
under
water
We'll
make
it
past
the
barrier
island
We'll
make
it
to
Te
Fiti
None
of
which
you
understand
because
you
are
a
chicken
No
Heihei
No
no
no
no
no
Te
Fiti
Maui
You
came
back
But
your
hook
One
more
hit
and
Maui
Te
Ka's
gotta
catch
me
first
I've
got
your
back
chosen
one
Go
save
the
world

Thank
you
Maui
You're
welcome
Hey

Moana
Te
Fiti
It's
gone
TEKA
Let
her
come
to
me
I
have
crossed
the
horizon
to
find
you
I
know
your
name
they
have
stolen
your
heart
from
inside
you
But
this
does
not
define
you
This
is
not
who
you
are
You
know
who
you
are
Who
you
truly
are
Te
Fiti
Maui
The
chicken
lives
Moana
I'm
sorry
about
your
hook
Maui
Well

No
hook
I'm
Maui
Te
Fiti
How
you've
been
Look
what
I
did
was
wrong
I
have
no
excuse
I'm
sorry
Moana
You
know
it
would
be
rude
to
reject
a
gift
from
a
Goddess
Maui
Thank
you
Your
kindness
is
deeply
appreciated
Cheehoo
Gonna
miss

King
Uhborn
And
they're

Grand
Pabbie
Here

You

lucky
it

The

not
so
easily
changed
but
the
head
can
be
persuaded
King
Do
what
you
must
Grand
Pabbie
I
recommend
we
remove
all
magic
even
memories
of
magic
to
be
safe
But
don't
worry
I'll
leave

fun
She
will

I
have

Listen

Elsa
your
power
will
only
grow
There
is
beauty
in
it
But
also
great
danger
You
must
learn
to
control
it
Fear
will
be
your
enemy
King
No
We'll
protect
her
She
can
learn
to
control
it
I'm
sure
Until
then
we'll
lock
the
gates
We'll
reduce
the
staff
We
will
limit
her
contact
with
people
and
keep
her
powers
hidden
from
everyone
Including
Anna
Young
Anna
Elsa
Do

used
to
be

buddies
and
now
we're
not
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
why
Do
you
want
to
build
a
snowman
It
doesn't
have
to
be
a
snowman
Young
Elsa
Go
away
Anna
Young

Okay

The

Don't

Young

Don't
let
it
show
Young
Anna
Do
you
want
to
build
a
snowman
Or
ride
our
bike
around
the
halls
I
think
some
company
is
overdue
I've
started
talking
to
the
pictures
on
the
walls
Hang
in
there
Joe
It
gets
a
little
lonely
all
these
empty
rooms
Just
watching
the
hours
tick
by
Teen
Elsa
I'm
scared
It's
getting
stronger
King
Getting
upset
only
makes
it
worse
Calm

No
Don't
touch
me
Please
I
don't
want
to
hurt

I'm

still
closed
I've
been
up
for
hours
Who

Kai
It's
still
me
ma'am
The
gates
will
open
soon
Time

Of

Ready

Your

Anna
My
sister's
corneration
It's
coronation
day
It's
coronation
day
The
window
is
open
So's
that
door
I
didn't
know
they
did
that
anymore
Who
knew
we
owned
eight
thousand
salad
plates
For
years
I've
roamed
these
empty
halls
Why
have
a
ballroom
with
no
balls
Finally
they're
opening
up
the
gates
There'll
be
actual
real
live
people
It'll
be
totally
strange
Wow
am
I
so
ready
for
this
change
Cause
for
the
first
time
in
forever
there'll
be
music
there'll
be
light
For
the
first
time
in
forever
I'll
be
dancing
through
the
night
Don't
know
if
I'm
elated
or
gassy
but
I'm
somewhere
in
that
zone
Cause
for
the
first
time
in
foreverI
won't
be
alone
I
can't
wait
to
meet
everyone
What
if
I
meet
the
one
Tonight
imagine
me
gown
and
all
Fetchingly
draped
against
the
wall
The
picture
of
sophisticated
grace
I
suddenly
see
him
standing
there
a
beautiful
stranger
tall
and
fair
I
wanna
stuff
some
chocolate
in
my
face
But
then
we
laugh
and
talk
all
evening
which
is
totally
bizarre
Nothing
like
the
life
I've
led
so
far
For
the
first
time
in
forever
there'll
be
magic
there'll
be
fun
For
the
first
time
in
forever
I
could
be
noticed
by
someone
And
I
know
it
is
totally
crazy
to
dream
I'd
find
romance
But
for
the
first
time
in
forever
at
least
I've
got
a
chance
Elsa
Don't
let
them
in
Don't
let
them
see
Be
the
good
girl
you
always
have
to
be
Conceal
Don't
feel
Put
on
a
show
Make
one
wrong
move
and
everyone
will
know
But
it's
only
for
today
Anna
It's
only
for
today
Elsa
It's
agony
to
wait
Anna
It's
agony
to
wait
Elsa
Tell
the
guards
to
open
upthe
gate
Anna
The
gate
For
the
first
time
in
forever
Elsa
Don't
let
them
in
don't
let
them
see
me
Anna
I'm
getting
what
I'm
dreaming
of
Elsa
Be
the
good
girl
you
always
have
to
be
Anna
A
chance
to
change
my
lonely
world
Elsa
Conceal
Anna
A
chance
to
find
true
love
Elsa
Conceal
Don't
feel
Don't
Let
them
know
Anna
I
know
it
all
ends
tomorrow
so
it
has
to
be
today
Cause
for
the
first
time
in
forever

Excuse

for
a
minute
Hans
Glad
I
caught
you
Anna
Hans
I
often
had
the
whole
parlor
to
myself
to
slide
Oops
Sorry
Your
physique
helps
I'm
sure
too
Hans
What's
this
Anna
I
was
born
with
it
Although
I
dreamt
I
was
kissed
by
a
troll
Hans
I
like
it
Anna
Yeah
The
whole
thing
You
got
it
Okay
Wait
wait
So
you
have
how
many
brothers
Hans
Twelve
older
brothers
Three
of
them
pretended
I
was
invisibleliterally
for
two
years
Anna
That's
horrible
Hans
It's
what
brothers
do
Anna
And
sisters
Elsa
and
I
were
really
close
when
we
were
little
But
then
one
day
she
just
shut
me
out
andand
I
never
knew
why
Hans
I
would
never
shut
you
out
Anna
Okay
can
I
just
say
something
crazy
Hans
I
love
crazy
Anna
All
my
life
has
been
a
series
of
doors
in
my
face
And
then
suddenly
I
bump
into
you
Hans
I
was
thinking
the
same
thing
because
like
Hans
I've
been
searching
my
whole
life
to
find
my
own
place
And
maybe
it's
the
party
talking
or
the
chocolate
fondue
Hans
But
with
you
Anna
But
with
you
I
found
my
place
Hans
I
see
your
face
Anna
and
Hans
And
it's
nothing
like
i've
ever
known
before
Anna
and
Hans
Love
is
an
open
door
Anna

never
met
someone
Hans
Who
thinks
so
much
like
me
Anna
and
Hans
Jinx

Our
mental
synchronization
can
have
but
one
explanation

be

this
land
She

Anna
Wait

Duke
You

Are

klled
me
Hans
You

on
ice
Duke
Her
ice
Anna
It
was
an
accident
She
was
scared
She
didn't
mean
it
She
didn't
mean
any
of
this
Tonight
was
my
fault
I
pushed
her
so
I'm
the
one
that
needs
to
go
after
her
Hans
What
Duke
Yes
Anna
Bring
me
my
horse
Please
Hans
Anna

It's
too
dangerous
Anna
Elsa's
not

bring
her
back
and
I'll
make
this
right
Hans
I'm
coming
with
you
Anna
No

you
here

take
care
of
Arendelle
Hans
On
my
honor
Anna
I

Prince
Hans
in
charge
Hans
Are
you
sure
you
can
trust
her
I
don't
want
you
getting
hurt
Anna
She's
my
sister
she
would
never
hurt
me
Let
It
Go
Elsa
The
snow
glows
white
on
the
mountain
tonight
not
a
footprint
to
be
seen
A
kingdom
of
isolation
and
it
looks
like
I'm
the
Queen
The
wind
is
howling
like
this
swirling
storm
inside
Couldn't
keep
it
in
heaven
knows
I
tried
Don't
let
them
in
don't
let
them
see
Be
the
good
girl
you
always
have
to
be
Conceal
don't
feel
don't
let
them
know
Well
now
they
know
Let
it
go
Let
it
go
Can't
hold
it
back
anymore
Let
it
go
Let
it
go
Turn
away
and
slam
the
door
I
don't
care
what
they're
going
to
say
Let
the
storm
rage
on
The
cold
never
bothered
me
anyway
It's
funny
how
some
distance
makes
everything
seem
small
And
the
fears
that
once
controlled
me
can't
get
to
me
at
all
It's
time
to
see
what
I
can
do
to
test
the
limits
and
break
through
No
right
no
wrong
no
rules
for
me
I'm
free
Let
it
go
Let
it
go
I
am
one
with
the
wind
and
sky
Let
it
go
Let
it
go
You'll
never
see
me
cry
Here
I
stand
and
here
I'll
stay
Let
the
storm
rage
on
My
power
flurries
through
the
air
into
the
ground
My
soul
is
spiraling
in
frozen
fractals
all
around
And
one
thought
crystallizes
like
an
icy
blast
I'm
never
going
back
the
past
is
in
the
past
Let
it
go
Let
it
go
And
I'll
rise
like
the
break
of
dawn
Let
it
go
Let
it
go
That
perfect
girl
is
gone
Here
I
stand
in
the
light
of
day
Let
the
storm
rage
on
The
cold
never
bothered
me
anyway
Anna
Elsa
Elsa
Elsa
It's
me
Anna
Your
sister
who
didn't
mean
to
make
you
freeze
the
summer
I'm
sorry
It'sit's
all
my
fffault
Of
course
none
of
it
would
have
happened
if
she'd
just
told
me
her
secret
She's
a
stinker
Oh
no
No
no
no
Come
back
No

Oookay
Snow

Anna
Oh

my
fault

then
she
freaked
out
because
I'd
only
just
met
him
you

that
day
And
she
said
she
wouldn't
bless
the
marriage
and
Kristoff
Wait
You

someone
you
just
met
that
day
Anna

grabbed
her
glove
Kristoff
Hang
on
You

met
that
day
Anna
Yes
Pay
attention
But
the
thing
is
she
wore
the
gloves
all
the
time
so
I
just
thought
maybe
she
has
a
thing
about
dirt
Kristoff
Didn't
your
parents
ever
warn
you
about
strangers
Anna
Yes
they
did

Sshhh

Anna

Kristoff
Wolves
Anna

What

we

Kristoff
I

this
Just
don't
fall
off
and
don't
get
eaten
Anna
But
I
wanna
help
Kristoff
No
Anna
Why
not
Kristoff
Because
I
don't
trust
your
judgment
Anna
Excuse
me
Kristoff
Who
marries
a
man
she
just
met
Anna
It's
true
love
Kristoff
Whoa
Whoa
Anna
Christopher
Kristoff
It's
Kristoff
Anna
Duck
Kristoff
You
almost
set
me
on
fire
Anna
But
I
didn't
Get
ready
to
jump
Sven
Kristoff
You
don't
tell
him
what
to
do
Anna
Hey
Kristoff
I

it
off
Uhoh

Anna
Grab

Woh
I'll
replace
your
sled

it
And
I
understand
if
you
don't
wanna
help
me
anymore
Kristoff
Of
course
I
don't
wanna
help
her
anymore
In
fact
this
whole
thing
has
ruined
me
for
helping
anyone
ever
again
But
she'll
die
on
her
own
I
can
live
with
that
Sometimes
I
really
don't
like
you
Hold
up
We're
coming
Anna
You
are
I
mean
sure
I'll
let
you
tag
along
Arendelle
Kristoff
It's
completely
frozen
Anna
But
it'll
be
fine
Elsa
will
thaw
it
Kristoff
Will
she
Anna
Yeah
Now
come
on
This
way
to
the
North
Mountain
Kristoff
More
like
this
way
Anna
I
never
knew
winter
could
be
so
beautiful
Olaf
Yeah
It
really
is
beautiful
isn't
it
But
it's
so
white
You
know
how
about
a
little
color
I'm
thinking
like
maybe
some
crimson
chartreuse
How
about
yellow
No
not
yellow
Yellow
and
snow
Brrrrno
go
Am
I
right
Hi
Kristoff
You're
creepy
Anna
I
don't
want
it
Kristoff
Woh
Back

ya
Olaf
Please
don't
drop
me
Kristoff
Come
on
it's
just
a
head
Anna
No
Olaf
Alright
we
got
off
to
a
bad
start
Anna
Ew
ew
the
body
Olaf
Wait
What
am
I
looking
at
right
now
Why
are
you
hanging
off
the
earth
like
a
bat
Anna
Alright
Wait
one
second
Olaf
Oh
Thank
you
Anna
You're
welcome
Olaf
Now
I'm
perfect
Anna
Well
almost
Olaf
It
was
like
my
whole
life
got
upside
down
Wooh
Anna'
Oh
Too
hard
I'm
sorry
I
was
just
Olaf
Head
rush
Anna
Are
you
okay
Olaf
Are
you
kidding
me
I
am
wonderful
I've
always
wanted
a
nose
So
cute
It's
like
a
little
baby
unicorn
What
Hey
Woh
Oh
I
love
it
even
more
Hah
Alright
let's
start
this
thing
over
Hi
everyone
I'm
Olaf
And
I
like
warm
hugs
Anna
Olaf
That's
right
Olaf
Olaf
And
you
are
Anna
Oh
umI'm
Anna
Olaf
And
who's
the
funkylooking
donkey
over
there
Anna
That's
Sven
Olaf
Uhhuh
And
who's
the
reindeer
Anna
Sven
Olaf
Oh
They'reoh
okay
Makes
things
easier
for
me
Ha
Aw
look
at
him
trying
to
kiss
my
nose
I
like
you
too
Anna
Olaf
did
Elsa
build
you
Olaf
Yeah
Why
Kristoff
Fascinating
Anna
Do
you
know
where
she
is
Olaf
Yeah
Why
Anna
Do
you
think
you
could
show
us
the
way
Olaf
Yeah
Why
Kristoff
How
does
this
work
Ow
Olaf
Stop
it
Sven
Trying
to
focus
here
Yeah
Why
Kristoff
I'll
tell
you
why
We
need
Elsa
to
bring
back
summer
Olaf
Summer
Anna
Mmhmm
Olaf
Oh
I
don't
know
why
but
I've
always
loved
the
idea
of
summer
and
sun
and
all
things
hot
Kristoff
Really
I'm
guessing
you
don't
have
much
experience
with
heat
Olaf
Nope
But
sometimes
I
like
to
close
my
eyes
and
imagine
what
it'd
be
like
when
summer
does
come
Bees'll
buzz
kids'll
blow
a
dandelion
fuzz
And
I'll
be
doing
whatever
snow
does
in
summer
A
drink
in
my
hand
my
snow
up
against
the
burning
sand
Probably
getting
gorgeously
tanned
in
summer
I'll
finally
see
a
summer
breeze
blow
away
a
winter
storm
and
find
out
what
happens
to
solid
water
when
it
gets
warm
And
I
can't
wait
to
see
what
my
buddies
all
think
of
me
Just
imagine
how
much
cooler
I'll
be
in
summer
Dadadadoo
Ahbahbahbahbahbahbooh
The
hot
and
the
cold
are
both
so
intense
Put
'em
together
it
just
makes
sense
Ratdadatdaddadadadadoo
Winter's
a
good
time
to
stay
in
and
cuddle
but
put
me
in
summer
and
I'll
be
a
Happy
snowman
When
life
gets
rough
I
like
to
hold
on
to
my
dream
of
relaxing
in
the
summer
sun
just
letting
off
steam
Oh
the
sky
will
be
blue
And
you
guys
will
be
there
too
When
I
finally
do
what
frozen
things
do
in
summer
Kristoff
I'm
gonna
tell
him
Anna
Don't
you
dare
Olaf
In
summer
So
come
on
Elsa's
this
way
Let's
go
bring
back
summer
Anna
I'm
coming
Kristoff
Somebody's
gotta
tell
him
Man
No

You've
got
the
bark
facing
down
The
bark

while
you
give
away
all
of
Arendelle's
tradeable
goods
Hans
Princess
Anna
has
given
her
orders
Duke
And
that's
another
thing
Has
it
dawned
on
you
that
your
princess
may
be
conspiring
with
a
wicked
sorceress
to
destroy
us
all
Hans
Do
not
question
the
Princess
She
left
me
in
charge
and
I
will
not
hesitate
to
protect
Arendelle
from
treason
Duke

Princess
Anna

find
her

of
the
crowd
step
forward
to
volunteer
Duke
I
volunteer
two
men
my
Lord
Be
prepared
for
anything
And
should
you
encounter
the
Queen
you
are
to
put
an
end
to
this
winter
Do
you
understand
Kristoff
So
how
exactly
are
you
planning
to
stop
this
weather
Anna
Oh
I
am
gonna
talk
to
my
sister
Kristoff
That's
your
plan
My
ice
business
is
riding
on
you
talking
to
your
sister
Anna
Yup
Kristoff
So
you're
not
at
all
afraid
of
her
Anna
Why
would
I
be
Olaf
Yeah
I
bet
she's
the
nicest
gentlest
warmest
person
ever
Oh
look
at
that
I've
been
impaled
Anna
What
now
Kristoff
Mm
It's
too
steep
I've
only
got
one
rope
and
you
don't
know
how
to
climb
mountains
Anna
Says
who
Kristoff
What
are
you
doing
Anna
I'm
going
to
see
my
sister
Kristoff
You're
gonna
kll
yourself
I
wouldn't
put
my
foot
there
Anna
You're
distracting
me
Kristoff
Or

How
do
you

Elsa
even
wants
to
see
you
Anna
Alright
I'mI'm
just
blocking
you
out
cause
I
gotta
concentrate
here
Kristoff
You
know
most
people
who
disappear
into
the
mountains
want
to
be
alone
Anna
Nobody
wants
to
be
alone
Except
maybe
you
Kristoff
I'm
not
alone
I
have
friends
remember
Anna
You
mean
the
love
experts
Kristoff
Yes
the
love
experts
Anna
Please
tell
me
I'm
almost
there
Does
the
air
seem
a
bit
thin
to
you
up
here
Kristoff
Hang
on
Olaf
Hey
Sven
Not
sure
if
this
is
gonna
solve
the
problem
but
I
found
a
staircase
that
leads
exactly
where
you
want
it
to
go
Anna
Haha
Thank
goodness
Catch
Thanks
That
was
like
a
crazy
trust
exercise
Woh
Kristoff
Now

ice
I
might
cry
Anna
Go
ahead
I
won't
judge
Kristoff

gotcha
Okay

knows
how
to
knock
Anna
It

That's

first
Oh

should
probably
wait
out
here
Kristoff
What
Anna
Last
time
I
introduced
her
to
a
guy
she
froze
everything
Kristoff
Butbutoh

this
mountain
together
You

to
live
in
fear
Cause
for

first
time
in

I
will
be

guys
Anna
They're
rocks
Kristoff
You
are
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
Olaf
He's
crazy
Kristoff
Hey
woh
I
didn't
even
recognize
you
You've
lost
so
much
wight
Olaf
I'll
distract
them
while
you
run
Hi
Sven's
family
It's
nice
to
meet
you
Because
I
love
Anna
I
insist
you
run
I
understand
you're
love
experts
Wooh
Why
aren't
you
running
Anna
Uhokay
Well
I'm
gonna
go
Kristoff
No
no
no
Anna
wait
Anna
Kristoff
Bulda
Kristoff's
home
Olaf
Kristoff's
home
Wait
Kristoff
Troll
Ah
let
me
look
at
you
Troll
Take
off
your
clothes
I'll
wash
them
Kristoff
No
I'mI'm
gonna
keep
my
clothes
on
Look
it's
great
to
see
you
all
but
where
is
Grand
Pabbie
Kid
Troll
He's
napping
But
look
I
grew
a
mushroom
Kid
Troll
I
earned
my
fire
crystal
Troll
I
passed
a
kidney
stone
Kid
Troll
Kristoff
pick
me
up
Kristoff
You're
getting
big
Good
for
you
Anna
Trolls
They're
trolls
Bulda
He's
brought
a
girl
All
Trolls
A
girl
Anna
What's
going
on
Kristoff
I've
learned
to
just
roll
with
it
Bulda
Let
me
see
Bright
eyes
Working
nose
Strong
teeth
Yes
yes
She'll
do
nicely
for
our
Kristoff
Anna
Wait
wait
wait
Oh
Umno
Kristoff
You've
got
the
wrong
idea
Anna
No
Kristoff
No
That's
not
why
I
brought
her
here
Anna
Right
We're
not
I'm
not
Bulda
What's
the
issue
dear
Why
are
you
holding
back
from
such
a
man
Is
it
the
clumpy
way
he
walks
Kristoff
What
Troll
Or
the
grumpy
way
he
talks
Anna
Oh
no
Troll
Or
the
pearshaped
squareshaped
weirdness
of
his
feet
Kristoff
Hey
Troll
And
though
we
know
he
washes
well
he
always
ends
up
sorta
smelly
Bulda
and
Troll
But
you'll
never
meet
a
fella
who's
as
sensitive
and
sweet
Anna
That's
nice
But
Bulda
and
Troll
So
he's
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
So
he's
got
a
few
flaws
Troll
Like
his
peculiar
brain
dear
Troll
His
thing
for
the
reindeer
Troll
and
Troll
That's
a
little
outside
of
nature's
laws
Kristoff
This
is
not
about
me
All
Trolls
So
he's
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
but
this
we're
certain
of
You
can
fix
this
fixer
upper
up
with
a
little
bit
of
love
Anna
Um
Kristoff
Can
we
please
just
stop
talking
about
this
We've
got
a
real
actual
problem
here
Kristoff
Can
we
please
just
stop
talking
about
this
We've
got
a
real
actual
problem
here
Bulda
I'll
say
So
tell
me
dear
is
it
the
way
that
he
runs
scared
Troll
Or
that
he's
socially
impaired
Kid
Troll
Or
that
he
only
likes
to
tinkle
in
the
woods
Anna
I
did
not
need
to
know
that
Troll
Are
you
holding
back
your
fondness
due
to
his
unmanly
blondness
All
Trolls
Or
the
way
he
covers
up
that
he's
the
honest
goods
He's
just
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
He's
got
a
couple
of'
bugs
Kristoff
No
I
don't
All
Trolls
His
isolation
is
confirmation
of
his
desperation
for
healing
hugs
So
he's
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
but
we
know
what
to
do
The
way
to
fix
up
this
fixer
upper
is
to
fix
him
up
with
you
Kristoff
Stop
it
Stop
it
Stop
it
Enough
She's
engaged
to
someone
else
Okay
Boy
Troll
So
she's
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
Boy
Troll
That's
a
minor
thing
Boy
Troll
Her
quote
engagement
is
a
flex
arrangement
Kid
Troll
And
by
the
way
I
don't
see
no
ring
All
Boy
Trolls
So
she's
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
her
brain's
a
bit
betwixt
Get
the
fiance
out
of
the
way
and
the
whole
thing
will
be
fixed
Bulda
We
aren't
saying
you
can
change
him
cause
people
don't
really
change
We're
only
saying
that
love's
a
force
that's
powerful
and
strange
People
make
bad
choices
if
they're
mad
or
scared
or
stressed
But
throw
a
little
love
their
way
All
Girl
Trolls
Throw
a
little
love
their
way
and
you'll
bring
out
their
best
True
love
brings
out
the
best
All
Trolls
Everyone's
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
that's
what
it's
all
about
Boy
Troll
Father
Girl
Troll
Sister
Kid
Troll
Brother
All
Trolls
We
need
each
other
to
raise
us
up
and
round
us
out
Everyone's
a
bit
of
a
fixer
upper
but
when
push
comes
to
shove
Olaf
The
only
fixer
upper
fixer
that
can
fix
a
fixer
upper
is
All
Trolls
True
true
true
true
love
Love
love
love
true
love
True
Troll
Priest
Do
you
Anna
take
Kristoff
to

married
All

Love
Kristoff
Anna

Grand

There
is
strange
magic
here
Kristoff
Grand
Pabbie
Grand
Pabbie
Come
come
Bring
her
here
to
me
Anna
your
life
is
in
danger
There
is
ice
in
your
heart
put
there
by
your
sister
If
not
removed
to
solid
ice
will
you
freeze
forever
Anna
What
No
Kristoff
But
you
can
remove
it
right
Grand
Pabbie
I
cannot
I'm
sorry
Kristoff
If
it
was
her
head
that
would
be
easy
but
only
an
act
of
true
love
can
thaw
a
frozen
heart
Anna
An
act
of
true
love
Bulda
A
true
love's
kiss
perhaps
Kristoff

with
her
powers
Hans
You
said
she'd
never
hurt
you
Anna
I
was
wrong
Hans
Anna
Anna
She
froze
my
heart
and
only
an
act
of
true
love
can
save
me

A
true
love's

Oh
Anna
If
only
there
was
someone
out
there
who
loved
you
Anna
What
Hans
gets
up
and
walks
towards
the
window
You
said
you
did
Hans
As
thirteenth
in
line
in
my
own
kingdom
I
didn't
stand
a
chance
I
knew
I'd
have
to
marry
into
the
throne
somewhere
Anna
Butwhat
are
you
talking
about
Hans
As
heir
Elsa
was
preferable
of
course
but
no
one
was
getting
anywhere
with
her
But
you
Anna
Hans
Hans
You
were
so
desperate
for
love
you
were
willing
to
marry
me
just
like
that
I
figured
after
we
married
I'd
have
to
stage
a
little
accident
for
Elsa
Anna
Hans
No
stop
Hans
But
then
she
doomed
herself
and
you
were
dumb
enough
to
go
after
her
Anna
Please
Hans
All
that's
left
now
is
to
kll
Elsa
and
bring
back
summer
Anna
You're
no
match
for
Elsa
Hans
No
you're
no
match
for
Elsa
I
on
the
other
hand
am
the
hero
who
is
going
to
save
Arendelle
from
destruction

with
this
Hans

to
her
Hans
She

klled

Queen
Elsa
Duke

Her
own
sister
Hans
At

we
got
to
say
our
marriage
vowsbefore
she
died
in
my
arms
Duke
There
can
be
no
doubt
now
Queen
Elsa
is
a
monster
and
we
are
all
in
grave
danger
Spanish
Dignitary
Prince
Hans
Arendelle
looks
to
you
Hans
With
a
heavy

Olaf
Whoa
So
this
is
heat
I
love
it
Ooh
But
don't
touch
it
So
where's
Hans
What
happened
to
your
kiss
Anna
I
was
wrong
about
him
It
wasn't
true
love
Olaf
But
we
ran
all
the
way
here
Anna
Please
Olaf
you
can't
stay
here
you'll
melt
Olaf
I
am
not
leaving
here
until
we
find
some
other
act
of
true
love
to
save
you
Do
you
happen
to
have
any
ideas
Anna
I
don't
even
know
what
love
is
Olaf
That's
okay
I
do
Love
is
putting
someone
else's
needs
before
yours
Like
you
know
how
Kristoff
brought
you
back
here
to
Hans
and
left
you
forever
Anna
Kristoff
loves
me
Olaf
Wow
you
really
don't
know
anything
about
love
do
you
the
fire
starts
to
melt
his
face
and
he
pushes
his
nose
back
in
Anna
Olaf
you're
melting
Olaf
Some
people
are
worth
melting
for
Just
maybe
not
right
this
second
Don't
worry
I've
got
it
We're
going
to
get
through
Oh
wait
Hang
on
I'm
getting
something
It's
Kristoff
and
Sven
They're
coming
back
this
way
Anna
Theythey
are
Olaf
Wow
he's
really
moving
fast
I
guess
I
was
wrong
I
guess
Kristoff
doesn't
love
you
enough
to
leave
you
behind
Anna
Help
me
up
Olaf
Please
Olaf
No
no
no
no
no
You
need
to
stay
by
the
fire
and
keep
warm
Anna
I
need
to
get
to
Kristoff
Olaf
Why
Oh
I
know
why
There's
your
act
of
true
love
right
there
Riding
across
the
fjords

a
valiant
pungent
reindeer

Just

care
of
my
sister
Hans
Your
sister
She
returned
from
the
mountain
weak
and
cold
She
said
that
you
froze
her
heart
Elsa
No
Hans
I
tried
to
save
her
but
it
was
too
late
Her
skin
was
ice
her
hair
turned
white
Your

of
you

yourself
for
me
Anna
I
love

An

will
thaw
a
frozen
heart
Elsa
Love

Olaf
Hands

the
best
day
of
my
lifeand
quite
possibly
the
last
Hans
Anna
But
she
froze
your
heart
Anna
The
only
frozen
heart
around
here
is
yours
French
Dignitary
I
will
return
this
scoundrel
to
his
country

twelve
big
brothers
think
of
his
behavior
Kai
Arendelle
