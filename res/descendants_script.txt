Once
upon
a
time
long
long
ago
Well
more
like
years
ago
Belle
married
her
beast
in
front
of
of
their
closest
personal
friends
Big
cake
Yeah
so
instead
of
a
honeymoon
Beast
united
all
the
kingdoms
and
got
himself
elected
king
of
the
United
States
of
Auradon
He
rounded
up
all
the
villains
and
sidekicks
basically
all
the
really
interesting
people
and
he
booted
them
off
to
the
isle
of
the
lost
with
a
magical
barrier
to
keep
them
there
This
is
my
hood
no
magic
no
wifi
no
way
out
Or
so
I
thought
hang
on
you're
about
to
meet
us
But
first
this
happened
Ahha
How
is
it
possible
that
you're
going
to
be
crowned
king
next
month
You're
just
a
baby
He's
turning
dear
Hey
pops
That's
far
too
young
to
be
crowned
king
I
didn't
make
a
good
decision
until
I
was
a
least
Uh
you
decided
to
marry
me
at
Ah
it
was
either
you
or
a
teapot
Kidding
I'm
only
kidding
Mom
Dad
Ah
I've
chosen
my
first
official
proclamation
I've
decided
that
the
children
on
the
isle
of
the
lost
be
given
a
chance
to
live
here
in
Auradon
Everytime
I
look
out
to
the
island
I
feel
like
they've
been
abandoned
The
children
of
our
sworn
enemies
Living
among
us
We
start
out
with
a
few
at
first
only
the
ones
who
need
our
help
the
most
I've
already
chosen
them
Have
you
I
gave
you
a
second
chance
Who
are
their
parents
Cruella
De
Vil
Jafar
Evil
Queen
and
Maleficent
Maleficent
She
is
the
worst
villain
in
the
land
Dad
just
hear
me
out
here
I
won't
hear
of
it
They
are
guilty
of
unspeakable
crimes
Dad
their
children
are
innocent
Don't
you
think
they
deserve
a
shot
at
a
normal
life
Dad
I
suppose
their
children
are
innocent
Well
well
done
Shall
we
They
say
I'm
trouble
They
say
I'm
bad
They
say
I'm
evil
And
that
makes
me
glad
Jay
A
dirty
no
good
Down
to
the
bone
Your
worst
nightmare
Can't
take
me
home
So
I
got
some
mischief
In
my
blood
Can
you
blame
me
I
never
got
no
love
They
think
I'm
callous
A
lowlife
hood
I
feel
so
useless
Misunderstood

the
dreadful

Mom
It's
the

When

was
cursing
entire

go
to
a
different
school
in
Auradon
What
I'm
not
going
to
some
boarding
school
filled
to
the
brim
with
prissy
pink
princesses
And
perfect
princes
Ugh
Yeah

I
don't
do
uniforms
Unless
It's
leather
You
feel
me
I
read
somewhere
that
they
allow
dogs
in
Auradon
Mom
said
they're
rabid
pack
animals
who
eat
boys
who
don't
behave
Woof

wand
Easy

What
is
in
it
for

Matching

watching
innocent
people
suffer

scepter
I
will
be
able
to
bend
both
good
and
evil
to
my
will
Our
will
Our
will

And
if
you
refuse
you're
grounded
for
the
rest
of
your
lives

touch
up
my
roots
fluff
my
fur
and
scrape
the
bunions

new
school
wouldn't

fairy
godmother
As
in
Bibbidi
bobbidi
boo
Bibbidi
bobbidi
You
know
it
Yeah
I
always
wondered
what
it
felt
like
for
Cinderella
when
you
just
appeared
out
of
nowhere
with
that
sparkly
wand
and
warm
smile
Oh
And
that
sparkling
wand
That
was
a
long
time
ago
And
as
I
always
say
don't
focus
on
the
past
or
You'll
miss
the
future
It's
so
good
to
finally
meet
you
all
I'm
Ben
Prince
Benjamin
Soon
to
be
king
You
had
me
at
prince
My
mom's
a
queen
which
makes
me
a
princess
The
evil
queen
has
no
royal
status
here
and
neither
do
you
This
is
Audrey
Princess
Audrey
His
girlfriend
Right
Bennyboo
Ben
and
Audrey
are
going
to
show
you
all
around
and
I'll
see
you
tomorrow
The
doors
of
wisdom
are
never
shut
But
the
library
hours
are
from
to
And
as
you
may
have
heard
I
have
a
little
thing
about
curfews
It
is
so
so
so
good
to
finally
me
meet
you
all
This
is
a
momentous
occasion
and
one
that
I
hope
will
go
down
in
history
Is
that
chocolate
As
the
day
our
two
peoples
began
to
heal
Or
the
day
that
you
showed
four
peoples
where
the
bathrooms
are
A
little
bit
over
the
top
A
little
more
than
a
little
bit
Well
so
much
for
my
first
impression
Hey
You're
Maleficent's
daughter
aren't
you
Yeah
you
know
what
I
totally
do
not
blame
you
for
your
mother
trying
to
kill
my
parents
and
stuff
Oh
my
mom's
Aurora
Sleeping
Beauty
Yeah
I've
heard
the
name
You
know
and
I
totally
do
not
blame
your
grandparents
for
inviting
everyone
in
the
whole
world
but
my
mother
to
their
stupid
christening
Water
under
the
bridge
Totes
Okay
So
how
about
a
tour
Yeah
Auradon
prep
originally
built
over
years
ago
and
converted
into
a
high
school
by
my
father
when
he
became
king
Carlos
It's
okay
My
father
wanted
his
statue
to
morph
from
beast
to
man
to
remind
us
that
anything
is
possible
Does
he
shed
much
Yeah
mom
won't
let
him
on
the
couch
So

guys
have
a
lot
of
magic
here
in
Auradon
Like
wands
and
things
like
that
Yeah
it
exists
of
course
but
It's
pretty
much
retired
Most
of
us
here
are
just
ordinary
mortals

be
kings

insecure
Argued
with
my
mother
too
thought
I
was
mature
But
I
put
my
heart
aside
and
I
used
my
head
Now
I
think
it's
time
you
learned
what
dear
old
momma
said
Don't
you
wanna
be
evil
like
me
Don't
you
wanna
be
mean
Don't
you
wanna
make
mischief
your
daily
routine
Well
you
can
spend
your
life
attending
to
the
poor
But
when
you're
evil
doing
less
is
doing
more
Don't
you
wanna
be
ruthless
and
rotten
and
mad
Don't
you
wanna
be
very
very
good
at
being
bad
I
have
tried
my
whole
life
long
to
do
the
worst
I
can
Clawed
my
way
to
victory
built
my
master
plan
Now
the
time
has
come
my
dear
for
you
to
take
your
place
Promise
me
you'll
try
to
be
an
absolute
disgrace
Don't
you
wanna
be
evil
like
me
don't
you
wanna
be
cruel
Don't
you
wanna
be
nasty
and
brutal
and
cool
And
when
you
grab
that
wand
that's
when
your
reign
begins
Who
wants
an
evil
queen
without
a
sack
of
sin
Don't
you
wanna
be
heartless
and

raw
talent
Come

seen

It's
called
a
rule
book
Welcome

team
son
You
ever
thought
about
band
I'll
work
with
him
coach
All
right
Let's
run
that
again
Whoo
I'm
rotten
to
the
core
Those
kids
are
trouble
Bye
Mal
Bye
Come
on
Chad
Give
them
a
chance
Oh
No
offense
Bennybear
but
you're
just
too
trusting
Look
I
know
your
mom
fell
in
love
with
a
big
nasty
beast
who
turned
out
to
be
a
prince
But
with
my
mom
the
evil
fairy
was
just
the
evil
fairy
That
girl's
mother
I
think
you're
wrong
about
them
I'll
see
you
later
Hey
Hey
How
was
your
first
day
Super
You
should
really
think
about
taking
this
talent
off
the
locker
and
into
art
class
I
could
uh
sign
you
up
What
do
you
think
Way
to
take
all
the
fun
out
of
it
Huh
Hi
It's
Jane
right
Ah
always
loved
that
name
Jane
That's
cool
Don't
go
I
guess
I
was
just
kind
of
hoping
to
make
a
friend
You
probably
have
all
the
friends
you
need
though
huh
Hardly
Really
I
mean
with
your
mom
being
fairy
godmother
and
headmistress
I
mean
not
to
mention
your
own
um
personality
I'd
rather
be
pretty
You've
got
great
hair
You
know
what
I
have
just
the
thing
for
that
It's
right
Ah
here
Beware
forswear
replace
the
old
with
brand
new
hair
Oh
ah
ah
Wow
You
almost
don't
notice
your
Other
features
anymore
Do
my
nose
Oh
I
can't
I've
been
practicing
but
you
know
I
can't
do
really
big
magic
Not
like
your
mom
with
her
wand
I
mean
one
swoosh
from
that
thing
and
you
could
probably
have
whatever
features
you
wanted
She
doesn't
use
the
wand
anymore
She
believes
the
real
magic
is
in
the
books
And
not
the
spell
books
regular
books
with
history
and
stuff
What
a
rip
Yeah
You
know
she
used
magic
on
Cinderella
who
wasn't
even
her
real
daughter
Doesn't
she
love
you
Well
of
course
she
does
It's
It's
just
you
know
tough
love
Work
on
the
inside
not
the
outside
You
know
that
sort
of
thing
That's
the
face
Yeah
and
then
just
look
as
If
your
your
heart
is
about
to
break
Oh
mother
I
just
don't
understand
why
you
can't
make
me
beautiful
too
Think
it
would
work
Yeah
I
mean
that's
what
old
Cindy
did
right
And
your
mother
Bibbidi
bobbidi
booed
the
living
daylights
out
of
her
And
hey
If
your
mom
does
decide
to
you
know
break
out
the
old
wand
invite
me
If
I
can
convince
mom
you're
so
there
Yay
Bye
Bye
Any
chance
he's
in
line
for
a
throne
Anywhere
in
line
Chad
Prince
Charming
Jr
Cinderella's
son
Chad
inherited
the
charm
but
not
a
lot
of
there
there
know
what
I
mean
Looks
like
there
there
to
me
Mr
Deley
Evie
Perhaps
this
is
just
review
for
you
So
tell
me
what
is
the
average
atomic
weight
of
silver
Atomic
weight
Uh
well
not
very
much
I
mean
It's
an
atom
right
Let's
see
How
do
I
find
the
average
atomic
weight
of
silver
That
would
be
times
plus
times
which
Mr
Deley
would
give
us
as
Amu
I
forget
Always
a
mistake
to
underestimate
A
villain
Don't
make
it
again
Okay
Carlos
we're
gonna
do
some
sprints
You
ready
Oh
Ah
No
wait
Sweet
No
Ah
Carlos

Whoa
Ben

my
throat
This

a
vicious
rabid
pack
animal
Hey

told
you

My
mother
Cruella
She's
a
dog
expert
A
dog
yellerer
Why

you
holding
him
He's
gonna
attack
you
Carlos

never
actually
met
a
dog
have
you
Of
course
not
Dude
meet
Carlos
Carlos
this
is
dude
He's
the
campus
mutt
He
doesn't
look
like
a
vicious
rabid
pack
animal
Jeez
You're
a
good
boy
aren't
you
You're
a
good
boy
I
guess
you
guys
have
it
pretty
rough
on
the
island
Yeah
Let's
just
say
we
don't
get
a
lot
of
belly
rubs
Good
boy
I
mean
you're
a
good
runner
You're
you're
fast

space

You

each
other
and
just
you
know
come
find
me
when
you're
done
okay
Okay
I'll
see
you
later
See
you
out
there
Hi
Hi
Oh
Thank
you
Is
everybody
at
home
as
pretty
as
you
I
like
to
think
I'm
the
fairest
of
them
all
How
many
rooms
in
your
castle
Oh
Too
many
to
count
You
really
nailed
that
chemistry
problem
today
You're
gonna
have
all
the
nerds
in
love
with
you
I'm
not
that
smart
Oh
come
on
No
really
I'm
not
But
I'm
I'm
really
good
at
sewing
and
cooking
and
cleaning
You
know
like
your
mother
Cinderella
without
the
ratty
dress
See
this
If
I
ask
it
where
something
is
it
tells
me
Are
you
kidding
me
No
Where's
my
cell
phone
It
won't
work
for
you
silly
No
biggie
My
dad
will
just
get
me
a
new
one
Prince
charming
Yeah
And
cinderella
Yeah
Hey
I
heard
her
wand
is
in
some
boring
museum
Do
they
always
leave
it
there
I'd
really
like
to
talk
but
I'm
just
swamped
Unless
Unless
If
you
could
knock
all
my
homework
out
along
with
yours
then
maybe
we
could
get
together
sometime
Hang
Okay
Thanks
babe
Yeah
Bye
I
couldn't
help
but
overhear
Are
you
stalking
me
Technically
yes
I
too
have
a
fascination
with
fairy
godmother's
wand
Which
is
another
reason
I
look
forward
to
the
coroation
Perhaps
we
could
sit
next
to
each
other
and
discuss
its
attributes
Are
you
saying
they
use
it
in
the
coronation
Yes
And
asking
you
out
Mom
said
If
a
boy
can't
see
the
beauty
within
then
he's
not
worth
it
Can
you
believe
it
What
world
does
she
live
in
Auradon
Mal
do
you
like
Yeah
It's
cute
It
brings
out
your
eyes
I
know
I'll
never
get
a
boyfriend
Boyfriends
are
overrated
And
how
would
you
know
Mal
You've
never
had
one
It's
cause
I
don't
need
one
E
They're
a
waste
of
time
I
forgot
to
do
Chad's
homework
Oh
no
Oh
no
no
no
And
that
is
exactly
what
I
mean
Hey
guys
I'm
Lonnie
My
mom's
Mulan
No
Anyways
I
love
what
you've
done
with
Jane's
hair
And
I
know
you
hate
us
and
well
you're
evil
But
do
you
think
you
could
do
mine
Why
would
I
do
that
for
you
I'll
pay
you
dollars
Good
answer
I
need
to
buy
more
material
Let's
see
I'm
thinking
we
lose
the
bangs
maybe
some
layers
and
some
highlights
Yeah
yeah
I
want
it
cool
Like
Mal's
Mal
Really
The
split
ends
too
Okay
Beware
forswear
replace
the
old
with
cool
hair
I
know
I
know
It
looks
like
a
mop
on
your
head
You
know
what
Let's
cut
it
off
layer
it
No
no
no
no
no
no
I
love
it
You
do
It's
just
Now
I'm
cool
Like
ice
What
did
I
just
do
Mom's
gonna
kill
me
I
could
really
use
a
tough
guy
like
you
The
team's
a
bunch
of
princes
If
you
know
what
I
mean
You're
telling
me
It's
all
after
you
old
chum
Oh
pardon
me
did
I
bump
into
you
Where
I
come
from
It's
prepare
to
die
sucker
As
my
father
says
the
only
way
to
win
is
to
make
sure
everyone
else
loses
Jay
Jay
Jay
Jay
You
rip
Let
me
explain
a
team
Uh
It's
like
a
family
You
do
not
want
to
be
at
my
house
at
dinner
time
Okay
okay
um
You
know
how
a
body
has
a
lot
of
different
parts
The
legs
elbows
ears
But
they
all
need
each
other
Well
that's
what
a
team
is
different
players
who
work
together
to
win
Make
any
sense
Can
I
be
the
fist
Yo
ho
ho
Hey

Did
your
plan
work
with

Jane
Are
you
going
over
to
see
the
wand
Do
you
think
that
I
would
be
going
through
every
single
spell
in
this
book
If
I
hadn't
completely
struck
out
Oh
someone's
in
a
bad
mood
My
mom's
counting
on
me
I
can't
let
her
down
We
can
do
this
If
we
stick
together
And
we
won't
go
back
until
we
do
Because
we're
rotten
To
the
core
Oh
yeah
I
found
out
that
fairy
godmother
blesses
Ben
with
the
wand
at
coronation
and
we
all
get
to
go
I
have
nothing
to
wear
of
course
What
Hold
that
thought
Hey
Mal
I
didn't
see
you
guys
today
I
was
just
wondering
If
you
had
any
questions
or
anything
That
you
needed
Not
that
I
know
of
Okay
All
right
Well
uh
If
you
need
anything
just
uh
Oh
wait
Um
is
it
true
that
we
all
get
to
go
to
your
coronation
Yeah
the
whole
school
goes
Wow
That
is
beyond
exciting
Do
you
think
that
It's
a
possibility
that
the
four
of
us
could
stand
in
the
front
row
next
to
the
Fairy
Godmother
just
so
we
could
soak
up
all
that
goodness
I
wish
you
could
Up
front
It's
just
me
my
folks
and
my
girlfriend
And
your
girlfriend
Yeah
I'm
sorry
Okay
Thanks
bye
Oh
but
no
there's
plenty
of
I
think
It's
time
that
Bennyboo
got
himself
a
new
girlfriend
And
I
need
a
love
spell
All
right
It
says
that
we
still
need
one
tear
and
I
never
cry
Let's
just
chop
up
some
onions
No
It
Says
that
we
need
one
tear
of
human
sadness
And
this
love
potion
gets
the
best
so
we
have
to
follow
it
exactly
A
tear's
a
tear
That's
not
true
Jay
They
both
have
antibodies
and
enzymes
but
an
emotional
tear
has
more
proteinbased
hormones
than
a
reflex
tear
Listen
to
you
Yeah
I
knew
that
Did
not
Yeah
I
did
There
you
are
Mal
I
was
looking
for
you
You
know
all
the
girls
want
you
to
do
their
hair
Midnight
snack

Nothing

dip
Feel

it
might
be
missing
something
Hey

It
could
use
some
chips
Chips

are
Chocolate
chips
Just
the
most
important
food
group
Wait

your
moms
ever
make
you

like
chocolate
chip
cookies
Like
when
you're
feeling
sad
and
they're
fresh
from
the
oven
with
a
big
old
glass
of
milk
and
she
just
makes
you
laugh
and
puts
everything
into
perspective
and
why
are
you
all
looking
at
me
like
that
It's
just
different
where
we're
from
Yeah

thought
Even

love
their
kids
Oh
How
awful

bummer

have
to
get
these
into
the
oven

Scoring

goal

She

it

Jane's
hair

and
Fairy
Godmother's
not
happy
about
it
What's
the
harm
It's
gateway
magic
Sure

starts
with
the
hair
Next
thing

know
It's
the
lips
and

clothes

I
feel
like
if
she
were
talented
like
you
and
she
knew
how
to
sew
and
knew
beauty
tips
that
she
wouldn't
need
a
prince
to
make
her
feel
better
about
herself
I
guess
I
am
kind
of
talented
You
are
definitely
gifted

didn't

for

after
I
don't
I've
just

been
thinking
you

know
when
the
villains

finally
do
invade

Auradon
and
begin
to

loot
and
kick
everyone

out
of
their
castles
and

imprison
their
leaders

and
destroy
all
that
is

good
and
beautiful
Ben

still
being
in
love
with

me
just
seems
a
little

extra
cruel
The
Kitchen


A
million
thoughts
in

my
head


Should
I
let
my

heart
keep
listening



I
know
It's
time

to
say
goodbye



So
hard
to
let
go

Auradon
Prep
Ma
cherie

Mademoiselle
It
is
with
deepest

pride
and
greatest

pleasure
That
we

welcome
you
tonight
And
now
we
invite

you
to
relax
Let
us

pull
up
a
chair
As
the

dining
room
proudly

presents

Your

dinner

Be
our
guest


Be
our
guest



Put
our
service
to
the

test


Tie
your

napkin
'round
your

neck
cherie


And
we'll
provide
the
rest



Soup
du
jour



Hot
hors
d'oeuvres



Why
we
only
live

to
serve


Try
the

grey
stuff


It's

delicious


Don't

believe
me


Ask

the
dishes


They
can
sing



They
can
dance



After
all
Miss
this
is
France


And

the
dinner
here
is

never
second
best


Go
on
unfold
your

menu


Take
a

glance
and
then
you'll


Be
our
guest



Oui
our
guest


Be
our
guest

We
tell
jokes



I
do
tricks


With

my
fellow

candlesticks


And
it's
all
in

perfect
taste



That
you
can
bet


Come
on
and
lift

your
glass



You've
won
your
own
free
pass


To
be

our
guest


If
you're
stressed


It's
fine
dining
we

suggest


Be
our
guest



Be
our
guest


Be
our
guest

find
yourself
But
it's

of
Drizella
my
sweet
sweet
friend
my
Dizzy
Next
the
son
of
Smee
Come
on
Squeaky
And
no
way
we're
splitting
up
the
twins
so
get
over
here
Squirmy
come
on
Bring
it
in
buddy
And
last
but
certainly
not
least
we
all
picked
this
girl
because
we
all
agreed
that
she
could
use
a
little
bit
of
Fairy
Godmother's
goodness
class
Give
it
on
up
for
Dr
Facilier's
daughter
Celia
I'm
bad
We'll
be
back
for
you
guys
next
week
okay
Yeah
so
pack
your
stuff
your
own
stuff
Where
are
you
going
We're
going
to
Auradon
Not
a
tentacle
in
sight
I
think
if
Uma
was
up
to
something
it'd
be
done
by
now
No
Ben
I
know
how
villains
think
and
I
don't
trust
Uma
as
far
as
I
can
throw
her
She's
gonna
wait
until
our
defenses
are
down
and
then
that's
when
she's
gonna
strike
I
really
wish
I
had
time
to
go
do
a
dragon
flyover
because
I
can
go
much
higher
Well
you
can't
be
everywhere
at
once
Besides
I've
got
your
back
Come
on
everyone's
waiting
for
us
Wait
You're
getting
more
guards
I'm
getting
more
guards
Now
breathe
Come
on
Okay
Here
they
come
Oh
stay
Stay
here
Yes
Bippity
boppity
one
two
one
two
can
everybody
hear
me
Yes
Ben
Thank
you
Fairy
Godmother
What's
up
Auradon
Thank
you
thank
you
so
much
for
coming
out
to
welcome
our
new
arrivals
They'll
be
here
soon
Not
like
we
had
a
choice
It
worked
out
pretty
well
for
the
first
four
Yeah
especially
for
you
Really
funny
Mal
this
is
the
exact
spot
we
first
met
not
so
long
ago
I
feel
like
I've
known
you
my
whole
life
But
did
I
mention
I'm
in
love
with
you
I
met
this
girl
who
rocked
my
world
Like
it's
never
been
rocked
And
now
I'm
living
just
for
her

And
I
won't
ever
stop
I
never
thought
that
it
could
happen
To
a
guy
like
me
But
now
look
at
what
you've
done
you've
got
me
Down
on
my
knee
Mal
it's
you
and
me
It's
you
and
me
forever
Will
you
marry
me
Will
you
be
my
queen
No
Yes
I
am
so
sorry
It's
okay
Makes
our
movie
night
seem
a
little
tame
I
love
yo
Movies
Me
too
Yeah
A
lifetime
of
plans
Gone
Our
family
status
gone
Audrey
you
were
supposed
to
be
his
queen
and
you
let
him
slip
through
your
fingers
Your
mother
could
hold
on
to
a
prince
in
her
sleep
Don't
you
think
I
feel
bad
enough
already
Grammy
Ben
and
Mal
are
the
best
I'm
so
excited
for
Mal
to
be
our
queen
You'd
really
rather
have
a
VK
on
the
throne
than
me
What
is
wrong
with
you
people
What
is
wrong
with
everybody
I'm
engaged
man
What
Did
you
know
Everything
You

gonna
rock
that
crown

a
thousand
sketches

your
wedding
dress

engagement

You

all
of
Auradon
Touching
story
for
the
grandkids
Okay

do
this
Speaking
of
kids
we
have
some
kids
waiting
on
us
so

you'll
excuse
me
Congratulations
Lady
Mal
Thank

Your

Alright

You're

Do

Yes
I

Are

Granny

I'll
miss
you
Go

Goodbye
Granny
Here
let
me
get
this
off
you
Oh
Okay
Let's
go
and
do
this
So
as
soon
as
we
get
to
Auradon
you
have
to
try
ice
cream
And
go
swimming
I
can
take
you
to
the
Enchanted
Lake
I
can't
believe
I
get
to
live
with
you
in
your
very
own
castle
It's
just
a
little
starter
castle
Great
grip
You
play
sports
Here
Go
on
Trust
me
on
this
I
know
Dig
in
dig
in
You're
going
to
be
a
wise
and
brave
king
He
already
is
See
The
cards
never
lie
Ah
The
only
reason
they
should
be
opening
that
barrier
is
for
putting
Uma
back
in
not
letting
more
villains
out
It's
Hades
Stop
the
car
he's
trying
to
escape
I
am
a
god
I
don't
belong
here
Do
not
panic
Okay
nobody
needs
to
panic
It's
Mal
There's
your
precious
queen
she
can't
even
protect
us
Okay
we're
panicking
bippityboppity
run
Come
on
Mal
Blast
him
Are
you
okay
Are
you
okay
No
He
was
draining
all
of
my
magic
with
the
ember
and
I
felt
all
of
my
power
slipping
away
You're
safe
He's
back
where
he
belongs
Yeah
for
now
We
should
go
Okay
A
lifetime
of
plans
gone
Your
mother
could
hold
on
to
a
prince
in
her
sleep
I'm
so
tired
of
pretending
Where's
my
happy
ending
I
followed
all
the
rules
I
drew
inside
the
lines
I
never
asked
for
anything
that
wasn't
mine

I
waited
patiently
for
my
time

But
when
it
finally
came
he
called
her
name

And
now
I
feel
this
overwhelming
pain
I
mean
it's
in
my
veins
I
mean
it's
in
my
brain
My
thoughts
are
running
in
a
circle
like
a
toy
train

I'm
kinda
like
a
perfect
picture
with
a
broken
frame

I
know
exactly
who
to
blame
I
never
thought
of
myself
as
mean

I
always
thought
that
I'd
be
the
queen

And
there's
no
inbetween
'Cause
if
I
can't
have
that
Then
I
will
be
the
leader
of
the
dark
and
the
bad

Now
there's
a
devil
on
my
shoulder

Where
the
angels
used
to
be
And
he's
calling
me
the
queen

Being
nice
was
my
pastime
But
I've
been
hurt
for
the
last
time

And
I
won't
ever
let
another
person
take
advantage
of
me

The
anger
burns
my
skin
third
degree

Now
my
blood's
boiling
hotter
than
a
fiery
sea

There's
nobody
getting
close
to
me

They're
gonna
bow
to
the
evil
queen

Your
nightmare's
my
dream
Just
wait
until
they
fall
to
my
wicked
schemes

I
never
thought
of
myself
as
mean

I
always
thought
that
I'd
be
the
queen

And
there's
no
inbetween
'Cause
if
I
can't
have
that
Then
I
will
be
the
leader
of
the
dark
and
the
bad

Now
there's
a
devil
on
my
shoulder

Where
the
angels
used
to
be
And
he's
calling
me
the
queen
of
mean

The
queen
of
mean
Calling
me
calling
me
The
queen
of
mean
Something's
pulling
me
it's
so
magnetic

My
body
is
moving
unsure
where
I'm
headed

All
of
my
senses
have
left
me
defenseless

This
darkness
around
me
is
promising
vengeance

The
price
that
I'm
willing
to
pay
is
expensive

There's
nothing
to
lose
When
you're
lonely
and
friendless

So
my
only
interest
is
showing
this
princess

That
I
am
the
queen
and
my
reign
will
be
endless

I
want
what
I
deserve
I
wanna
rule
the
world
Sit
back
and
watch
and
learn

It's
finally
my
turn
If
they
want
a
villain
for
a
queen

I'm
gonna
be
one
like
they've
never
seen

I'll
show
them
what
it
means
Now
that
I
am
that
I
will
be
the
ruler
of
the
dark
and
the
bad

'Cause
the
devil's
on
my
shoulder

Where
the
angels
used
to
be
And
he's
calling
me
the
queen
of
mean

Calling
me
calling
me
The
queen
of
mean
Calling
me
calling
me
I
want
what
I
deserve
I
think
we
all
know
why
we're
here
The
people
are
in
a
panic
about
Hades
He
almost
got
out
Who
knows
what
he
would've
done
if
he
had
escaped
We
can't
risk
having
another
villain
on
the
loose
I
really
feel
like
this
is
my
fault
I'm
supposed
to
protect
Auradon
You
did
You
do
protect
Auradon
Every
time
we
open
the
barrier
we're
exposed
to
danger
Maleficent
Uma
Hades
Maleficent's
scepter
and
the
queen's
crown
have
been
stolen
Fairy
We
don't
know
that
Dad
When
the
people
hear
this
they
will
never
wanna
leave
their
houses
What
do
we
tell
them
Mal
what
do
we
do
How
do
we
keep
evil
out
of
Auradon
I
think
that
there's
only
one
way
to
guarantee
their
safety
And
I
think
that
therecan't
be
any
more
going
in
and
out
I
think
that
we
have
to
close
the
barrier
forever
No
Son
No
Ben
No
no
no
Ben
Hey
I
do
not
want
to
take
away
your
dream
because
it
was
so
beautiful
and
it
is
why
I
fell
in
love
with
you
But
as
king
and
as
queen
what's
our
duty
To
protect
Auradon
But
you
know
what
this
would
mean
All
those
kids
Are
you
prepared
for
that
I
know
what
it
means
And
no
I'm
not
prepared
for
it
I
just
think
that
we
have
no
other
choice
Son
Mal's
right
I
just
don't
think
that
we
would
forgive
ourselves
if
something
terrible
happened
Who
else
knows
about
the
crown
and
the
scepter
No
one
I
mean
think
about
it
people
are
scared
enough
as
it
is
We
have
to
employ
these
entirely
new
security
measures
Will
this
delay
our
bringing
over
more
VKs
We're
talking
about
closing
the
barrier
for
good
But
you
said
no
I
mean
the
four
of
us
are
living
the
dream
here
and
we
finally
get
to
share
that
I
mean
what
could
be
more
important
than
that
Yeah
I
know
I
mean
maybe
security
Or
maybe
peace
of
mind
for
everyone
in
Auradon
Is
that
what
they're
thinking
M
were
they
seriously
thinking
that
no
one
will
ever
go
in
and
out
of
the
Isle
ever
again
What
we
never
get
to
go
back
and
see
our
parents
And
what
about
these
kids
We
promised
them
that
they
could
go
back
and
visit
whenever
they
wanted
Yeah
I
know
M
I'm
so
glad
that
you
are
going
to
be
queen
You'll
be
a
part
of
these
conversations
you
will
stand
up
for
the
VKs
Thank
you
for
telling
me
And
you'll
be
a
great
queen
Wooh
Morning
Got
the
beach
towels
These
I
really
think
she's
gonna
like
the
cake
you
guys
Oh
yeah
Oh
no
Okay
who
got
into
Jane's
cake
Delicious
I
especially
love
the
lack
of
dirt
And
the
lack
of
flies
Want
some
Oh
Thank
you
I
was
hoping
you
were
home
Is
this
a
joke
What
are
you
doing
with
the
crown
and
the
scepter
Well
I
wanted
them
so
I
took
them
You
of
all
people
should
understand
that
Mal
Wait
Audrey
stop
Don't
use
that
I
thought
you
liked
spells
Okay
Audrey
Quiet
It's
not
a
toy
it's
dangerous
I
want
to
be
dangerous
My
life
was
perfect
until
you
stole
it
And
then
Auradon
turned
its
back
on
me
It's
time
for
a
little
payback
Audrey
wait
You
think
Ben
will
love
you
now
you
old
hag
You'll
pay
the
price
for
what
you
did
so
will
all
of
Auradon
So
long
suckers
Uh
you
might
wanna
think
of
a
spell
for
that
There's
no
spell
that
can
reverse
the
curse
of
the
scepter
Well
that's
a
shame
Forget
about
me
Audrey's
out
for
revenge
and
all
of
Auradon
is
in
danger
What
should
we
do
The
only
thing
more
powerful
than
the
scepter
is
Hades'
ember
Oh
like
he's
just
gonna
hand
it
over
if
you
blew
him
back
to
the
Isle
No
one
knows
where
his
lair
is
I
do
I'm
his
errand
rat
I've
got
the
key
at
my
dad's
You're
coming
But
I
just
got
here
Mal
Dizzy
stay
here
to
take
care
of
the
twins
we'll
be
right
back
and
everything
will
be
just
fine
Go

Guys

get
your
stuff

How

Okay
Oh

Okay
Almost

Noble

us
anywhere
Carlos
You're
gonna
miss
Jane's
birthday
Ah
Looks
like
Carlos
forgot
your
birthday
huh
Well
maybe
not
maybe
he
just
took
the
wrong
trail
or
something
Or
you
know
what
They
probably
don't
celebrate
birthdays
on
the
Isle
maybe
it's
like
a
cultural
thing
Oh
Yeah
Or
maybe
he
just
forgot
You
never
know
Hey
Chad
look
There's
people
taking
selfies
Selfies
Guys
Wait
wait
wait
wait
Wait

Wait

Looks

to
invite
me
Well
don't
be
expecting
Mal
she's
uhnot
feeling
herself
Does
that
make
you
sad
Aw
does
it
just
ruin
everything
Mindless
little
drones
How
could
you
forget
what
she
did
to
us
How
could
you
forget
that
I
was
supposed
to
be
your
queen
Time
out
Okay
time
out
First
off
great
new
look
I
absolutely
love
the
feathers
But
before
you
do
whatever
you're
gonna
do
I
was
wondering
if
maybe
you
wanted
a
uh
royal
boyfriend
by
your
side
Huh
Partner
in
crime
Sidekick
Or
maybe
just
a
lackey
to
uh
do
your
bidding
Change
tires
Smoothie
runs
Huh
Please
You
can
be
useful
Yeah
Fine
stand
behind
me
Okay
If
Auradon
likes
to
forget
so
much
they'll
love
this
Happy
birthday

you
Happy

Happy

You

Alerts

the
sleeping
spell

spreads
throughout
Auradon

Sleeping
Beauty's

vicious
lies

has
perpetrated

are
you
doing
here
I
noticed
you
were
low
on
canned
corn
Hi
Dad
Quite
a
show
you
put
on
the
other
day
Right
back
at
ya
Hmm
I
was
just
coming
to
see
you
Really
Wonder
why
Is
it
because
I'm
gonna
be
queen
Now
Mal
don't
be
bitter
You
abandoned
me
when
I
was
a
baby
No
No
I
left
your
mother
She's
she's
not
the
easiest
person
to
get
along
with
You
think
Oh
See
We
have
something
in
common
already
We
both
hate
your
mother
No
I
don't
hate
my
mother
She
may
be
an
evil
lunatic
but
at
least
she
stuck
around
Aww
Boohoo
Wake
up
and
smell
the
stink
You
think
you've
had
it
rough
I
used
to
be
a
god
I
had
an
entire
world
which
bore
my
name
and
now
I
have
nothing
You
have
no
idea
what
that
feels
like
Really
Because
for
16
years
I
had
nothing
And
now
I
have
a
whole
world
But
unless
I
get
that
ember
it's
game
over
Hold
please
Listen
little
girl
You're
talking
to
a
god
And
I
don't
wanna
hear
the
drama

Kindness
ain't
my
brand
Oh
I
guess
that's
why
you
ran
Try
being
married
to
your
momma

You
stink
at
being
a
dad
Poor
Mal
i
are
you
sad
Not
as
sad
as
you
without
your
powers

I
didn't
come
to
fight
For
once
do
something
right

I
steal
souls
Were
you
expecting
flowers
I
only
need
you
'cause
I
came
here
for
something

I've
given
you
everything
By
giving
you
nothing

By
giving
me
nothing
I
did
what
I
had
to
do

Woooohooh
No
you
only
did
what's
best
for
you

Well
you
can
learn
a
thing
or
two

When
push
comes
to
shove
you
do
what
you
gotta
do

You
were
never
there
Guess
you
don't
have
a
phone
You
never
called
to
say
I
miss
you

Are
you
kidding
Is
this
a
joke
You
need
to
let
it
go
You're
stronger
with
those
daddy
issues

Oh
thank
you
Show
me
some
respect
it
ain't
easy
to
neglect

My
attention
would
have
made
you
softer

Oh
Should
I
be
proud
Don't
turn
this
thing
around
I
guess
you
are
your
father's
daughter

Don't
think
I
need
you
I
just
came
here
for
something

I've
given
you
everything
By
giving
you
nothing

By
giving
me
nothing
I
did
what
I
had
to
do

Oohooh
ooh
I
made
it
on
my
own
no
thanks
to
you

Well
you
could
learn
a
thing
or
two

When
push
comes
to
shove
you
do
what
you
gotta
do

How
about
I
go
with
you
and
we'll
spend
some
time

How
about
you
stay
here
'cause
you're
out
of
your
mind

Let's
make
new
memories
you
can
show
me
the
town

No
you
can
keep
your
memories
now

Get
over
it
I
am
over
it
I'm
over
you
being
over
it
Let's
dance
I
did
what
I
had
to
do
No
you
only
did
what's
best
for
you

Well
you
could
learn
a
thing
or
two

When
push
comes
to
shove
you
do

When
push
comes
to
shove
you
do

When
push
comes
to
shove
you
do

What
you
gotta
do
Yeah
Ha
Puhlease
Do
you
wanna
make
up
for
being
a
lousy
dad
Give
me
the
ember
The
ember
only
works
for
me
No
it'll
work
for
me
We're
blood
You're
only
half
Hades
The
ember
won't
do
everything
for
you
that
it
does
for
me
I'll
take
my
chances
If
it
gets
wet
it's
game
over
That's
my
girl
I
guess
that's
the
reason
why
he's
always
asking
about
you
Evie
is
the
only
one
who
knows
that
he's
my
dad
And
as
far
as
I'm
concerned
he
doesn't
even
exist
No
no
I
want
the
Auradon
guard
handing
out
gas
masks
Well
not
everyone's
asleep
Find
out
if
anyone's
seen
Audrey
And
find
if
she
has
a
list
of
demands
Just
one
I
demand
my
life
back
I
have
a
proposition
I'll
wake
everybody
up
right
now
Under
one
itty
bitty
condition
Benny
Boo
Make
me
your
queen
and
we'll
rule
side
by
side
Did
someone
put
a
spell
on
you
You
just
tell
me
who
and
I'll
You'll
what
Marry
them
Most
people
get
dumped
because
they
aren't
good
enough
I
wasn't
bad
enough
How
do
you
like
me
now
Benny
Boo
I
like
the
old
Audrey
better
She
wouldn't
wanna
hurt
Auradon
Just
give
me
the
scepter
and
I'll
forgive
you
You'll
forgive
me
I
don't
think
so
Sleeping
is
too
good
for
you
Sleeping
is
too
good
for
Auradon
Alright
Get
in
get
out
Jay
you
good
Yeah
Okay
Hold
on
Whoa
you
got
a
little
Hades'
thing
going
Wow
That
thing
packs
a
punch
huh
Ha
We
made
it
bro
We
made
it
Hey
guys
we
just
come
for
a
wee
visit
Hey
Hey
Hey
No
Drop
something
It
can't
get
wet
Give
it
back
before
it
goes
out
Uma
That's
my
name
No
Hi
boys
Welcome
back
Uma
You
swam
off
and
forgot
all
about
us
Yeah
planning
her
revenge
no
doubt
It's
not
all
about
you
Mal
I
was
looking
for
a
hole
in
the
barrier
to
let
everybody
out
And
you
know
what
I
found
boys
It's
way
better
out
there
than
we
thought
There's
this
thing
that
looks
like
a
furry
rock
called
a
coconut
And
fish
so
big
you
could
dance
on
their
backs
And
they've
been
keeping
it
all
for
themselves
Whatever
Uma
I
need
that
to
break
a
spell
Cast
by
Audrey
Sleeping
Beauty's
daughter
Hmm
so
the
good
guy's
the
bad
guy
Well
I
might
not
give
it
back
See
what
happens
Uma
it's
not
the
time
for
games
People's
lives
are
in
danger
Guarantee
me
that
every
single
villain
kid
who
wants
to
can
get
off
the
Isle
I
can't
do
that
Can't
do
that
Well
how
about
now
Deal
Deal
Uma
Her
word
is
good
I'll
still
keep
this
for
the
time
being
Because
if
I
think
I
trust
you
to
save
the
world
on
your
own
think
again
This
is
a
job
for
pirates
We
can
always
go
back
to
hating
each
other
when
this
is
over
Fine
Where
are
our
bikes
Oh
yeah
We
crashed
them
Vrum
Look
at
his
face
Here's
a
thought
We
could
try
to
be
friends
Put
our
history
behind
us
and
celebrate
our
differences
Yeah
Who
wants
gum
Let's
go
No
Ah
No
I'm
in
charge
Let's
go
They're
asleep
Everyone
I
can't
get
Ben
Or
Dizzy
or
Doug
Or
Jane
the
signal's
out
Is
that
Auradon
Prep
Yeah
and
when
everybody
wakes
up
you're
gonna
love
it
Yes
Everything
is
so
Freakygreen
You
have
leaves
on
your
trees
And
what
are
those
color
things
in
the
bushes
Uh
flowers
Flowers
are
pretty
Cantaloupe
Mm
Mmmm
We
don't
have
any
fresh
fruit
on
the
Isle
remember
Mmm
Thank
you
They're
grapes
Grapes
Love
grapes
Ooh
I
believe
I
deserve
some
compensation
for
my
muscles
my
wile
and
my
role
in
this
endeavor
You
do
Me
not
squashing
you
like
a
bug
Like
I'm
scared
of
you
Jay
Guys
Mmm
Dude
Delicious
Mmm
Dude
really
What
It
wasn't
me
I
swear
Okay
it
was
me
Oh
do
you
know
what
happened
here
Yep
Audrey
showed
up
she
put
everybody
to
sleep
and
then
she
turned
some
of
them
to
Guys
Hannah
turned
to
stone
Alright
everybody
stay
on
their
toes
Look
since
we're
here
let's
check
the
school
No
Audrey
went
straight
for
the
crown
so
I
think
it's
safe
to
assume
she's
gonna
go
for
Ben
and
his
castle
next
That's
where
we'll
go
Says
who
Says
me
Says
you
That's
supposed
to
mean
something
to
me
Guys
To
the
castle
How
did
Mal
break
my
spell
I
don't
know
And
what
is
Uma
doing
here
No
no
no
no
Come
clean
Chad
Hey
hey
Where
did
they
go
I
don't
know
I
don't
know
okay
I
can
go
check
for
you
Stay
It's
about
to
get
a
little
ugly
Ben
Ha
This
way
Ugh
Ben
could
be
asleep
anywhere
Or
turned
to
stone
Okay
Ben
I
got
a
scent
very
pungent
cologne
easy
to
track
Follow
me
people
That's
great
Dude
FYI
I
give
great
cuddles
too
Really
I
never
had
a
pet
growing
up
Except
for
the
elk
head
in
dad's
man
cave
but
that's
not
really
Hold
up
What's
this
Uh
Any
chance
this
was
already
there
And
follow
me
Ben
Ben
Ben
Ben
Stay
here
Okay
I
can
feel
you
lurking
Good
So
you
can
track
cuddle
and
talk
Hey
do
you
think
his
puppies
will
be
able
to
talk
too
Alright
man
He's
taken
You
want
a
dog
Adopt
a
rescue
Talking
puppies
That's
crazy
Come
here
He
seems
nice
I
bet
you
lost
some
sleep
thinking
about
me
on
the
loose
huh
No
Dragons
don't
really
lose
sleep
I
wondered
what
fried
octopus
tastes
like
Okay
why
do
we
not
We're
celebrating
our
differences
I
believe
we're
being
challenged
Let's
split
up
and
look
for
Audrey
That
makes
absolutely
no
sense
unless
you
give
me
my
ember
she's
gonna
spell
you
Girls
We
have
a
situation
here
You
like
a
prince
Mal
How
about
a
knight
in
shining
armor
Or
knights
Watch
your
back
watch
your
back

Watch
your
back
watch
your
back

We
can
counter
their
attack
Hit
'em
'til
the
armor
cracks

This
could
get
a
little
sticky

How
to
win
this
battle
could
be
tricky

But
I
know
the
best
way
fall
back
let
me
lead

You
hold
the
line
And
we'll
bring
'em
to
their
knees

Swords
in
the
air
if
you're
with
me

Yeah
They
got
us
outnumbered
one
to
fifty

The
victory
is
ours
'cause
I've
got
a
strategy

You
take
the
left
and
the
rest
of
you
can
follow
me

Uhuh

This
is
my
crew
This
is
my
squad
This
my
turf
Oh
my
gosh
Look
guys
we
got
bigger
fish
to
fry

Put
your
differences
aside
'Cause
we're
now
all
on
the
same
side

Until
the
knight
falls
Everyone
We'll
stay
together
'til
the
battle
is
done

Watch
your
back
watch
your
back

Watch
your
back
watch
your
back

We
can
counter
their
attack
Hit
'em
til
the
armor
cracks

Until
the
knight
falls
we're
aligned

It
doesn't
mean
that
we're
on
the
same
side

Watch
your
back
watch
your
back

Watch
your
back
watch
your
back

Hit
'em
hard
hit
'em
fast
they're
too
heavy
to
react

The
situation's
getting
kinda
heavy

Hold
your
weapons
tight
keep
'em
steady

'Cause
if
we
stick
together
we
can
make
it
out
alive

I'll
cause
a
distraction
you
attack
them
from
the
side

All
my
soldiers
stand
at
the
ready

We
can
cut
'em
up
like
confetti

We'll
hit
'em
from
the
front
you
got
'em
from
behind

Don't
forget
the
fate
of
Auradon's
on
the
line

This
is
allout
war
They
got
us
outnumbered
The
way
the
swords
clash
is
the
sound
of
the
thunder

And
we
are
not
going
under
we
will
never
run
for
cover
We
battle
for
the
victory
and
ride
for
each
other

Until
the
knight
falls
Everyone
We'll
stay
together
'til
the
battle
is
done

Got
your
back
got
your
back
got
your
back
got
your
back

We
can
counter
their
attack
Hit
'em
til
the
armor
cracks
Until
the
knight
falls
we're
aligned

It
doesn't
mean
we're
on
the
same
side

Got
your
back
got
your
back
got
your
back
got
your
back

Hit
'em
hard
and
hit
'em
fast
they're
too
heavy
to
react
Suit
of
armor
strong
and
true
make
this
metal
bust
a
move
Ahahah
ahah
ah
Ahahah
No

Ahah
ah
Ahahah
ahah
ahah
Ahahah
ahah
ah

Ahahah
Woohoo
Until
the
knight
falls
you
can
trust

I'm
gonna
help
you
win
this
battle
because

Got
your
back
got
your
back
Got
your
back
got
your
back

All
for
one
and
that's
a
fact
knights
fall
pitch
black
Yeah
We
did
that
That's
what
I'm
talk
Ugh
Hey
good
job
No
No
Guys
come
on
This
was
so
great
We
were
a
team
We
worked
together
Come
on
Come
on
Mmmm
You
know
what
we
should
try
An
ice
breaker
You
say
something
you
really
like
about
the
other
person
Okay
I'll
start
Harry
Great
accent
Now
you
go
Is
she
always
this
perky
It
wasn't
really
your
turn
but
thank
you
Okay
Evie
Come
here
Yeah
I
love
you
I
love
you
I
love
this
energy
but
we
are
very
short
on
time
Audrey
clearly
knows
that
we're
here
we
need
to
get
out
of
here
ASAP
Alright
where
does
this
cheerleader
bunk
down
Even
if
she's
not
there
we
might
find
some
sort
of
clue
Actually
she's
still
in
the
dorms
You're
right
because
of
summer
school
What
Summer
school
Summer
School
No
wonder
she
wants
revenge
Okay
I
need
you
guys
to
go
find
Ben
We
will
meet
back
at
Evie's
in
two
hours
okay
Sounds
like
we're
going
with
my
plan
I'm
just
saying
It
was
kind
of
the
obvious
plan
Uma
said
it
first
Right
so
my
plan
Whatever
She's
nowhere
on
campus
Found
her
diary
And
dang
did
you
ruin
Audrey's
life
Okay
so
did
you
find
anything
in
there
that
we
don't
already
know
or
She
hangs
out
at
Fairy
Cottage
You
know
where
Flora
Fauna
and
Merryweather
hid
her
mom
from
your
mom
Yes
ha
ha
ha
the
irony
is
not
lost
on
me
How
can
anyone
with
this
bed
ever
be
unhappy
Okay
how
do
I
look
Okay
the
bling
stays
here
But
she's
bad
And
we're
not
Ben
Ben
Dude
Come
on
Nothing
These
things
just
grow
everywhere
Hey
we
should
play
that
ice
breaker
Um
Jay
I
like
the
way
that
you
can
bounce
around
and
jump
off
things
These
are
free
right
Yeah
um
I
like
how
you
get
a
kick
out
of
a
berry
bush
I
guess
you've
probably
seen
everything
by
now
huh
Furry
rocks
giant
fish
you're
probably
used
to
grabbing
lunch
off
of
a
bush
No
I
mean
usually
no
not
really
I
mainly
just
use
the
vending
machines
at
practice
Tourney
kinda
eats
up
most
of
my
time
so
Tourney
That's
a
wee
boy's
game
Right
You
know
what
would
be
fun
To
go
rafting
in
a
jungle
river
Find
a
lost
civilization
Ooh
maybe
a
penguin
Well
you
find
those
more
on
like
icebergs
but
I'd
love
to
see
one
of
those
You
guys
are
kllng
me
Mmm
PS
your
mutt
went
that
way
Carlos
Dude
what
do
you
see
This
way
I
really
hope
they
found
Ben
Nice
digs
I
got
a
really
good
deal
Shh
it's
okay
Don't
worry
Dizzy
We
can
fix
this
And
once
we
do
they're
gonna
let
all
the
kids
come
from
the
Isle
So
happy
dreams
Uh
who's
the
dude
Doug
Doug
Wake
up
Wake
up
He's
spelled
Is
she
not
a
fast
learner
She's
emotionally
involved
okay
Well
in
that
case
she
should
be
able
to
wake
him
up
True
love's
kiss
Works
every
time
Well
we
haven't
actually
used
the
L
word
yet
Can
we
be
alone
Don't
freak
out
it's
okay
'Cause
true
love
can
save
the
day

And
I
think
we
feel
the
same
but
I
don't
know

When
we
met
it
was
sweet
he
was
ohso
into
me

Seems
like
things
are
meant
to
be
but
I
don't
know

Does
he
love
me
or
does
he
love
me

It

Keep

calm

Think
he's
loved
me
all
along

But
maybe
I
got
it
wrong
so
I
don't
know

He's
so
good
got
my
back

But
maybe
I'm
just
too
bad
Could
we
be
a
perfect
match
Oh
I
don't
know

Does
he
love
me
or
does
he
love
me
not

Do
I
love
him
And
is
it
strong
enough

Ooh
ooh
ooh
One
kiss
one
kiss
It
all
comes
down
to
this
One
kiss
one
kiss
Oh
oh

One
kiss

This
moment
could
be
it
I
I
wanna

Ahooh

I

work

But

I'm
dreamdreamdreaming

This
is
gonna
hurt
Either
I
will
or
I
don't
What
if
I

Is

my
Romeo
Oh

only
one

way

really
know

It
all
comes
down

One

I

Ben
Oh

something
stinks

wasn't

time
No
Whoa
Watch

You
need
some
serious
nose
adjustments
I'm
not
so
sure
Ben
Did
Audrey
do
that
Ah
I
thought
I
recognized
those
pants
Aw
he's
got
a
booboo
that's
why
he's
so
cranky
You
know
my
dad
said
that
his
dad
did
not
handle
pain
well
at
all
You're
good
with
animals
Do
something
But
Okay
Alright
Okay
Ben
It's

Carlos
Alright

Huh
Oh

Yeah

You
need
another
blast
Uh
please
Please
Stop
Huh
It's
Enchanted
Lake
water
but
I
guess
it
can
only
do
so
much
Well
well
well
Harry
Hook
and
you
my
little
duckling
are
ravishing
Okay
uh
ravishing
and
taken
Just
in
case
anyone
was
confused
Hold
on
Whose
side
are
they
on
They
escaped
and
joined
us
Mal
has
the
ember
which
is
our
only
hope
to
stop
Audrey
Hades'
ember
Has
Mal
gone
back
to
the
Isle
I
said
we're
meeting
up
Mal
Evie
and
Uma
let's
go
Hey
Jay
um
Yeah
thanks
for
saving
me
gorgeous
face
That
was
a
really
good
idea
To
check
Audrey's
room
Now
we
know
that
we're
on
the
right
track
Is
there
an
insult
in
there
that
I
missed
Just
I
wanted
to
thank
you
Ugh
Think
you're
on
the
right
track
We're
not
going
anywhere
Let's
mess
them
up
a
little
I
say
we
go
back
to
my
place
and
maybe
binge
watch
some
TV
Huh
Or
maybe
order
some
stuff
online
Yeah
Yeah
Oh
What
about
pizza
Huh
You
don't
like
pizza
Salad
No
no
no
Audrey
Audrey
Audrey
I
don't
know
whose
birthday
it
is
but
I
want
this
cake
So
I
maybe
kinda
missed
the
boat
a
little
bit
on
calling
you
Shrimpy
and
not
letting
you
join
the
gang
Yeah
We
really
could've
torn
up
the
Isle
together
Celia
We're
trapped
Are
you
guys
okay
What's
going
on
You've
caused
my
friends
pain
and
fear
we've
had
enough
now
disappear
You
guys
I'm
sorry
my
spells
aren't
working
Audrey's
magic
is
getting
stronger
You
caused
our
friends
pain
and
fear
we
had
enough
now
disappear
You
did
it
Together
This
is
what
I've
been
talking
about
I
guess
my
shell
likes
you
Why
don't
you
hold
on
to
that
Hey
it's
your
bae
Hi
Hi
You
okay
You
okay
Yeah
I'm
so
much
better
right
now
Are
you
okay
Yeah
I
always
knew
you'd
be
part
of
the
solution
What
is
this
Oh
yeah
I
could
get
used
to
this
You
like
it
I
love
this
What
about
those
Oh
No
I
like
em
Okay
so
we
all
think
that
Audrey
could
be
at
Fairy
Cottage
We've
no
idea
where
it
is
did
she
take
you
there
Every
Fairy
Godmother's
Day
Where
is
Fairy
Godmother
when
you
need
her
I
wish
I
knew
Hey
um
this
might
be
a
bad
time
but
uh
happy
birthday
I
made
it
with
my
3D
printer
It's
uh
our
names
put
together
No
right
I
get
it
Yeah
Because
you
know
we're
together
you
and
me
you
know
like
a
couple
Right
'cause
Jane
and
Carlos
make
Jarlos
Yes
yeah
I
could've
gone
with
Cane
but
I
went
with
Jarlos
unless
you
prefer
Cane
do
you
prefer
Cane
Oh
no
No
I
love
it
Yes
you
do
it's
fine
you
know
what
I
can
remake
it
It's
cool
it's
fine
No
Carlos
It's
perfect
Doug
Go
with
Jane
You
need
to
find
Fairy
Godmother
They
might
need
some
muscle
Hey
Well
I'll
go
Yeah
actually
I
would
feel
better
Yeah
actually
I'd
feel
better
too
Same
Actually
I
would
too
Alright
man
let's
do
it
Let's
go
Jane
Okay
Be
careful
okay
I
will
Come
on
Dude
She's
not
upstairs
Chad
I
want
my
mommy
What
happened
It's
okay
What
happened
buddy
Hmm
Ben
Ben
Oh
Your
face
She's
gone
huh
The
door's
open
I'm
free
Free
Freedom
Oh
my
gosh
Hi
Mom
Um
I
don't
know
if
you
can
hear
me
but
it's
been
a
really
crazy
day
On
the
plus
side
it's
been
the
longest
birthday
I've
ever
had
On
the
minus
side
everybody's
under
an
evil
spell
Um
But
on
the
plus
side
Carlos
remembered
my
birthday
See
We're
going
to
figure
out
how
to
undo
this
We'll
find
a
way
to
make
this
right
Mom
Oof
alright
let's
get
this
Audrey
chick
taken
care
of
already
What
do
you
say
girl
Time
to
wrap
things
up
You
know
someday
you're
gonna
have
to
tell
me
how
you
guys
all
got
teamed
up
Actually
Mal
promised
to
let
all
the
kids
off
the
Isle
once
this
is
over
Mal
I
have
to
tell
you
guys
something
Um
I
lied
to
you
The
kids
won't
be
coming
off
the
Isle
What
do
you
mean
The
program
is
shut
down
And
the
barrier
will
be
closed
for
good
For
Auradon's
safety
Hold
up
So
we're
saving
your
precious
people
and
your
behinds
for
a
lie
I
knew
it
was
a
mistake
to
trust
you
You're
always
out
for
yourself
And
you
King
Benny
You're
probably
just
gonna
throw
us
all
back
inside
eh
You
know
what
I
actually
thought
you
were
brave
but
you're
nothing
but
a
chicken
Too
scared
to
tell
me
I
was
never
gonna
see
my
dad
again
Celia
Celia
Celia
No
Celia
no
no
Ugh
Regain
your
might
and
ignite
No
Regain
your
might
and
ignite
Bummer
Let's
go
find
Gil
and
leave
'em
all
to
rot
No
Uh
Uma
Evie
I'm
so
sorry
I'm
sorry
I
just
I
thought
that
I
was
afraid
to
tell
you
I
thought
that
I
was
gonna
lose
my
best
friend
But
I
had
to
do
something
I
had
to
protect
Auradon
Closing
the
barrier
was
your
idea
I
did
it
for
us
I
did
it
for
our
life
that
we
have
here
now
For
our
life
What
about
the
kids
that
we
left
behind
on
that
island
The
kids
that
we
promised
We
were
their
only
hope
I
thought
you
were
gonna
stand
up
for
the
VKs
But
instead
you
lied
to
them
And
you
lied
to
Jay
And
you
lied
to
Carlos
You
lied
to
me
We're
your
family
Evie
Evie
come
on
I
had
no
choice
No
Here
you
are
alone
and
you
deserve
it

Your
friends
have
turned
to
stone

And
that's
on
you
You
had
a
cause
to
serve
but
did
you
serve
it

Did
you
see
yourself
in
a
way
that
wasn't
true

Why
tell
all
those
lies
You
feel
unworthy

Like
there
isn't
solid
ground
for
you
to
stand

But
a
stack
of
lies
is
not
a
firm
foundation

You
cannot
build
a
castle
on
a
mountain
made
of
sand

This
is
not
your
father's
fairytale

And
no
it's
not
your
mother's
fault

You
fail
So
when
your
story
comes
to
light

Make
sure
the
story
that
they
write
goes

Once
upon
a
time
she
fought
a
dragon

Once
upon
a
time
that
beast
was
me

Once
upon
a
misspent
youth
She
faced
herself
she
spoke
the
truth

That's
how
I
see
my
once
upon
a
time

This
time
Uma
Uma
Stop
please
Stop
I
need
your
help
We
have
a
chance
if
we
do
this
together
Your
friends
kick
you
to
the
curb
Good
Ben
saw
something
in
you
and
today
Uma
I
saw
it
too
You
care
Uma
you
care
about
everybody
and
Auradon
is
worth
saving
Help
us
please
You
talk
pretty
but
she's
already
made
up
her
mind
You
brought
this
on
yourself
Mal
You
figure
out
how
to
fix
it
Let's
go
Life
is
not
a
storybook
But
life
unfolds
in
chapters
Turn
the
page
and
start
to
make
amends

There's
no
prewritten
guarantee

Of
happily
ever
after
Step
into
your
greatness
Before
your
story
ends
So
when
your
story
ends
They'll
say
Once
upon
a
time
a
girl
flew
higher

Once
upon
a
time
she
made
things
right

Once
upon
a
tie
that
binds
She
changed
her
heart
to
change
their
minds

That's
got
to
be
My
once
upon
a
time
This
once
upon
a
time
I'll
finally
see
my
once
upon
a
time

This
time
Help
me
Mal
Yeah
Save
your
little
friend
Mal
Help
me
Mal
Careful
not
to
fry
your
little
VK
buddy
Whoa
She
doesn't
stand
a
chance
without
the
ember
Help
me
Mal
Come
on
Hold
still
you
little
brat
We're
stronger
together
Stronger
together
I'm
right
here
Mal
Regain
your
might
and
ignite
I'm
right
here
girl
I'm
right
here
Regain
your
might
and
ignite
Yes
Want
a
piece
of
this
Huh
No
No
Come
on
Mal
Get
her
Mal
You
got
this
girl
Yeah
Come
on
Yeah
Mal
Oh
Celia
It's
okay
I've
got
you
Audrey
Oh
no
You're
only
half
Hades
The
ember
won't
do
everything
for
you
that
it
does
for
me
I'm
hungry
Same
Oh
Mom
Mom
Bippity
boppity
what
happened
The
spell
has
been
broken
It's
okay
Come
on
Let's
go
You
good
Yeah
She's
slipping
away
There's
only
one
person
in
the
world
who
might
be
able
to
do
something
about
this
and
that's
Hades
Hades
He
wouldn't
do
it
And
I
wouldn't
risk
it
Actually
he
might
do
it
for
me
He's
my
father
Okay
Well
I'll
have
to
send
guards
to
get
him
Maybe
I
can
hitch
a
ride
The
Isle
is
my
home
Someone
needs
to
be
there
to
protect
it
Well
then
you'll
need
your
first
mate
The
Isle
will
be
in
very
good
hands
Can
I
go
too
I
wish
I
could
be
in
both
places
I
really
think
that
Evie
was
right
And
I
do
think
that
we
could've
been
friends
And
I'm
really
sorry
that
I
lied
to
all
of
you
guys
You
deserve
so
much
better
than
that
You're
just
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
Yeah
I
get
it
Thank
you
for
coming
Didn't
have
much
choice
Can
you
wake
her
Since
when
do
heroes
care
about
villains
She's
One
of
your
own
Right
When
you
guys
try
to
destroy
the
world
it's
an
error
in
judgment
But
when
it's
one
of
us
lock
em
up
throw
away
the
key
Right
Beast
Yeah
I'm
gonna
need
to
use
my
hands
Haven't
lost
my
touch
Dad
Oh
Audrey
You're
okay
Tell
me
it
was
all
a
bad
dream
I
wish
I
could
But
it's
over
now
I'm
sorry
I
wanted
to
hurt
you
both
I
wanted
to
hurt
all
of
you
I
have
owed
you
an
apology
for
a
very
long
time
now
And
so
have
I
And
perhaps
I
have
owed
you
one
too
Oh
yeah
Dad
I'm
gonna
have
to
miss
you
all
over
again
Thanks
for
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
There
they
are
Hey
Lady
Mal
and
I
wanna
thank
you
for
celebrating
our
engagement
with
us
today
I
couldn't
be
prouder
or
happier
to
call
you
my
queen
So
raise
your
glasses
To
our
future
queen
of
Auradon
To
our
queen
of
Auradon
Speech
Your
Specialness
Speech
Oh
Fancy
One
I
can't
I
can't
be
queen
of
Auradon
Mal
I
can't
turn
my
back
on
the
Isle
We
made
a
decision
to
close
the
barrier
forever
And
it
was
my
idea
But
it's
wrong
I've
learned
that
you
can't
live
in
fear
Because
it
doesn't
actually
protect
you
from
anything
You
never
know
where
the
bad
is
gonna
come
from
And
you
never
know
where
the
heroes
are
gonna
come
from
either
Without
Uma
and
her
pirates
Auradon
would
be
gone
And
without
Hades
my
father
Audrey
would
be
gone
We
are
all
capable
of
good
and
bad
no
matter
which
side
of
the
barrier
we
come
from
And
that's
why
I
can't
be
queen
of
just
Auradon
I
have
to
be
queen
of
the
Isle
too
and
it's
time
that
we
take
the
barrier
down
forever
We
can't
do
that
It's
up
to
us
Dad
I
choose
to
be
a
king
who
moves
forward
It's
time
for
forgiveness
It's
time
for
new
beginnings
The
barrier
will
come
down
Yes
Bring
it
down
Mal
To
make
the
world
a
better
place
we
have
to
do
it
face
to
face
My
plan
Ha
Yes
It's
time
to
bring
it
together
Time
for
a
brand
new
start
We're
gonna
put
it
in
motion
Break
down
what
keeps
us
apart
No
more
no
division
we
down
New
team
got
the
vision
unite
United

stand

together
for
a
good
time
We're
gonna
break
this
down
We're

the
town
Everyone
all
around
Let's

Stronger

Believing
in

chances
And
