So
Mr
Incredibledo
you
have
a
secret
identity
MR
INCREDIBLE
Every
superhero
has
a
secret
identity
I
don't
know
a
single
one
who
doesn't
Who
wants
the
pressure
of
being
super
all
the
time
ELASTIGIRL
Of
course
I
have
a
secret
identity
Can
you
see
me
in
this
at
the
supermarket
Come
on
Who'd
want
to
go
shopping
as
Elastigirl
y'know
what
I
mean
FROZONE
Superladies
they're
always
trying
to
tell
you
their
secret
identity
Think
it'll
strengthen
the
relationship
or
something
like
that
I
said
''Girl
I
don't
want
to
know
about
your
mildmannered
alter
ego''
or
anything
like
that
I
mean
you
tell
me
you're
a
supermegaultralightningbabe
that's
all
right
with
me
I'm
good
I'm
good
MR
INCREDIBLE
No
matter
how
many
times
you
save
the
world
it
always
manages
to
get
back
in
jeopardy
again
Sometimes
I
just
want
it
to
stay
saved
you
know
For
a
little
bit
I
feel
like
the
maid
''I
just
cleaned
up
this
mess
Can
we
keep
it
clean
for
ten
minutes''
INTERVIEWER
I
could
get

point
MR
INCREDIBLE
''Please''
INTERVIEWER
Wait

Relax

raise
a

ELASTIGIRL
Settle

The
plaintiff
Oliver
Sansweet
who
was
foiled
in
his
attempted
suicide
by
Mr
Incredible
has
filed
suit
against
the
famed
superhero
in
Superior
Court
SANSWEET'S
LAWYER
Mr
Sansweet
didn't
ask
to
be
saved
Mr
Sansweet
didn't
want
to
be
saved
And
the
injury
received
from
Mr
Incredible
''actions''
so
quote
causes
him
daily
pain
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
Hey
I
saved
your

Five

another

was
filed
by
victims
of
the

losses
cost

opened
the

ANNOUNCER
Under
tremendous
public
pressure

the
crushing
financial
burden
of
an

of
lawsuits
the
government
quietly
initiated
the
superhero

program
The

be
granted
amnesty
from

in

for
the

What's

The

I
thought
you'd

said
I'd
be

HELEN
I
assumed
you'd
be
back
later
lf
you
came

be
''back

BOB
Well
I'm
back
okay
HELEN

BOB
with

full
It

a

Just
to

loose
HELEN
You

how
I
feel
about
that
Bob
Darn
you
We
can't
blow

BOB
The

coming
down

HELEN
What
You
knocked

BOB
It

bad

HELEN
It
is
a
bad
thing
Bob
Uprooting
our
family
again
so
you
can
relive
the
glory
days
is
a
very
bad
thing
BOB
Reliving
the
glory
days
is
better
than
acting
like
they
didn't
happen
HELEN
Yes
They
happened
But
this
our
family
is
what's
happening
now
Bob
And
you

I
can't
believe
you
don't
want
to
go
to
your
own
son's
graduation
BOB
It's
not
a
graduation
He's
moving
from
the
fourth
grade
to
the
fifth
grade
HELEN
It's
a
ceremony
BOB
It's
psychotic
They
keep
creating
new
ways
to
celebrate
mediocrity
but
if
someone
is
genuinely
exceptional
HELEN
This
is
not
about
you
Bob
This
is
about
Dash
BOB
You
want
to
do
something
for
Dash
Then
let
him
actually
compete
Let
him
go
out
for

HELEN
I

not
be
made
the

You

Because

kids
We're

VIOLET
Pretty
loud

Pigheadedness

BOB
What
you've

MR

What

Experts

Exploiting

RICK
Yeah
Every

Bob
It

hundreds
of
thousands
of
taxpayer's
dollars
BOB
I

RICK
We

We

The
Omnidroid
is
a
top
secret
prototype
battle
robot
lts
artificial
intelligence
enables
it
to
solve
any
problem
it's
confronted
with
And
unfortunately
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
Let
me
guess
It
got
smart
enough
to
wonder
why
it
had
to
take
orders
MIRAGE
We
lost
control
And
now
it's
loose
in
the
jungle
threatening
our
facility
We've
had
to
evacuate
all
personnel
from
the
island
for
their
own
safety
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
How
am
I
going
in
MIRAGE
The
Omnidroid's
defenses
necessitate
an
air
drop
from

lts
cloaking
devices
make
it
difficult
to
track
Although
we're
pretty
sure
it's
on
the
southern
half
of
the
island
One
more
thing
Obviously
it
represents
a
significant
investment
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
You
want
me
to
shut
it
down
without
completely
destroying
it
MIRAGE
You
are
Mr

MIRAGE
I've
got
to
warn
you
it's
a
learning
robot
Every
moment
you
spend
fighting
it
only
increases
its
knowledge
of
how
to
beat
you
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
Shut
it
down
Do
it
quickly
Don't
destroy
it

Oh

sorry
He
won't
be

He
hopes
you'll
understand
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
Of
course
I
do
usually
make
it
a
point
to
know
who
I'm
working
for
MIRAGE
He
prefers
a
certain
amount
of
anonymity
Surely
you
of
all
people
understand
that
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
I
was
just
wondering
of
all
the
places
to
settle
down
why
live
MIRAGE
With
a
volcano
He's
attracted
to
power
So
am
I
It's
a
weakness
we
share
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
Seems
a
bit
unstable
MIRAGE
I
prefer
to
think
of
it
as
misunderstood
BOB
MR
INCREDIBLE
chuckling
Aren't
we
all
MIRAGE
Volcanic

Now

That's
the

there's

they

for

Completely
bulletproof

Your
boy's

designed
to
withstand
enormous
friction
without
heating
up
or
wearing
out
A
useful
feature

Your
daughter's
suit
was

But
I
finally
created

Your
suit
can
stretch
as
far
as
you
can
without
injuring
yourself
and
still
retain
its
shape
Virtually
indestructibleyet
it
breathes
like
Egyptian
cotton
As
an
extra
feature
each
suit
contains
a
homing
device
giving
you
the
precise

location
of
the
wearer

DASH
and
I

he'd

I
came
here

you
closed

I
could
find
him

then
you

Oh

Hi
VIOLET
Uh
this
isn't
what
you
think
it
is
TONY
It
was
just
gettin'
too
freaky
I
couldn't
handle
it
and
ran
off
I
feel
kinda
bad
about
it
Maybe
I
should've
said
hi
or
somethin'
It's
not
her
fault
superheroes
are
illegal
And
it's
not
like
I
don't
like
strong
girls
I'm
pretty
secure
manhoodwise
What
is
that
Have
you
told

Excuse
me
Mr

FROZONE
Sorry
but
I'm
not
really
supposed
to
be
here
TOMMY
Which
seems
wrong
doesn't
it
Perhaps
you'd
be
interested
in
changing
that
law
Superheroes
including
Frozone
Mr
Incredible
and
Elastigirl
caused
further
damage
to
the
city
The
Underminer
remains
at
large
We
didn't
start
this
fight
Well
you
didn't
finish
it
either
Did
you
stop
the
Underminer
from
inflicting
from
damage
No
Did
you
stop
him
from
robbin'
on
the
banks
No
Did
you
catch
him
No
The
banks
were
insured
We
have
infrastructure
in
place
to
deal
with
these
matters
If
you
had
simply
done
nothin'
everything
would
now
be
proceeding
in
an
orderly
fashion
You'd
have
preferred
we
do
nothin'
Without
a
doubt
You
weren't
much
help
Do
you
want
outta
the
hole
First
you
gotta
put
down
the
shovel
Wel
that
went
poorly
Dad
this
is
probably
not
the
best
time
to
tell
you
about
this
but
something
else
happened
today
with
a
kid
and
my
mask
INDISTINCT
CHATTER
Oh
hey
Rick
Violet
thinks
a
friend
of
hers
a
kid
named
Tony
might
have
seen
her
in
the
outfit
without
her
mask
Talkative
type
Don't
know
Last
name
is
Rydinger
Tony
Rydinger
I'll
check
it
out
Bob
Helen
a
word
if
you
don't
mind
Uh
the
program's
been
shut
down
What
Politicians
don't
understand
people
who
do
good
simply
because
it's
right
It
makes
'em
nervous
DICKER
They've
been
gunnin'
for
Supers
for
years
Today
was
all
they
needed
Anyway
I'm
done
I'm
afraid
two
more
weeks
in
the
motel
is
the
best
I
can
do
for
ya
It
ain't
much
You've
done
plenty
Rick
We
won't
forget
Well
it
has
been
a
great
honor
working
with
you
good
people
Thanks
for
everything
and
good
luck
Yeah
You
too
JACKJACK
COOING
Did
you
wash
your
hands
WATER
RUNNING
With
soap
Did
you
dry
them
What
Is
this
all
vegetables
Who
ordered
all
vegetables
I
did
They're
good
and
you're
going
to
have
some
GROANS
Are
we
going
to
talk
about
it
What
The
elephant
in
the
room
What
elephant
I
guess
not
then
You're
referrin'
to
today
Yeah
what's
the
deal
with
today
We
all
made
mistakes
For
example
you
kids
were
supposed
to
watch
JackJack
Babysitting
while
you
guys
did
the
important
stuff
We
talked
about
this
You're
not
old
enough
to
decide
about
these
things
We
are
old
enough
to
help
out
Yeah
Isn't
that
what
you
tell
us
Dad
Yeah
well
help
out
can
mean
many
different
things
But
we're
supposed
to
help
if
there's
trouble
Well
yeah
but
Aren't
you
glad
we
helped
today
Yeah
I
know
but
You
said
that
you
were
proud
of
us
Well
yeah
I
was
Am
We
wanna
fight
bad
guys
BABBLING
No
you
don't
You
said
things
were
different
now
And
they
were
on
the
island
But
I
didn't
mean
that
from
now
on
So
now
we've
gotta
go
back
to
never
using
our
powers
It
defines
who
I
am
We're
not
saying
you
have
What
Someone
on
TV
said
it
Can
we
just
eat
The
dinner
while
it's
hot
Did
we
do
something
wrong
Yes
BOB
No
We
didn't
do
anything
wrong
Superheroes
are
illegal
Whether
it's
fair
or
not
that's
the
law
The
law
should
be
fair
What
are
we
teaching
our
kids
To
respect
the
law
Even
when
the
law
is
disrespectful
If
laws
are
unjust
there
are
laws
to
change
them
Otherwise
it's
chaos
Which
is
exactly
what
we
have
I
just
thought
it
was
kinda
cool
What
was
Fighting
crime
has
a
family
SIGHS
It
was
cool
But
it's
over
The
world
is
what
it
is
We
have
to
adapt
Are
things
bad
Things
are
fine
May
I
be
excused
DRAMATIC
MUSIC
PLAYING
ON
TV
How
much
longer
in
the

Dad
Uh
Not
much
longer
honey
HELEN
What
are
we
gonna
do
BOB
I
don't
know
Maybe
Dicker
will
find
somethin'
Dicker
is
done
Bob
Any
thought
we
had
about
being
Supers
again
is
fantasy
One
of
us
has
gotta
get
a
job
One
of
us
You
did
a
long
stint
at
Insuricare
Hated
every
minute
of
it
I
know
it
was
hard
on
you
Maybe
it's
my
turn
in
the
private
sector
and
you
take
care
of
the
kids
No
I'm
doin'
this
I
need
to
do
this
You
know
where
my
suit
and
ties
are
Burned
up
when
BOTH
The

LUCIUS
Don't
be
mad
because
I
know
when

I'm
just
as
illegal
as
you

Besides
I
knew
the
cops
would
let
you
go
Yeah
is
spite
of
Bob's
best
efforts

I
heard
the

shut

it
off
to
everyone
He
was
heartbroken
when
you
were
all
forced
to
go
underground
Father
believed
the
world
would
become
more
dangerous
without
you
He
didn't
know
how
right
he
was
There
was
a
breakin
BOTH
GASP
WINSTON
My
father
called
Gazerbeam
The
direct
line
LINE
BEEPS
No
answer
He
called
Fironic
no
answer
Superheroes
had
just
been
made
illegal
The
robbers
discovered
him
on
the
phone
and
shot
him
GUNSHOT
So
ELASTIGIRL
It
must've
been
hard
EVELYN
Especially
for
Mother
She
died
a
fer
months
later
Heartbreak
If
superheroes
had
not
been
forced
underground
it
never
would've
happened
Or
Dad
could've
taken
Mom
to
the
safe
room
as
soon
as
he
knew
there
was
trouble
I
disagree
strongly
But
we're
not
going
into
it
right
now
The
point
is
nobody
expected
us
to
be
able
to
actually
run
Dad's
company
But
with
Evelyn
as
designer
and
myself
as
operator
uh
we
threw
ourselves
into
building
DEVTECH
into
what
it
is
today
FROZONE
A
worldclass
telecommunications
company
Bigger
than
ever
Perfectly
positioned
to
make
some
wrong
things
right
Hence
this
meeting
Let
me
ask
you
something
What
is
the
main
reason
you
were
all
forced
underground
Ignorance
Perception
Take
today
for
example
with
the
Underminer
Difficult
situation
You
were
faced
with
a
lot
of
hard
decisions
Oh
tell
me
about
it
WINSTON
I
can't
Because
I
didn't
see
it
neither
did
anyone
else
So
when
you
fight
bad
guys
like
today
people
don't
see
the
fight
or
what
led
up
to
it
They
see
what
politicians
tell
them
to
see
The
see
destruction
and
they
see
you
So
if
we
wanna
change
people's
perceptions
about
superheroes
we
need
you
to
share
your
perceptions
with
the
world
How
do
we
do
that
EVELYN
With
the
cameras
We
need
you
to
share
your
perceptions
with
the
world
ELASTIGIRL
How
do
we
do
that
EVELYN
We
embed
tiny
cameras
like
those
into
your
Supersuits
Wow
so
small
And
the
picture
is
outstanding
Thanks
Designed
'em
myself
WINSTON
We've
got
resources
lobbyists
worldwide
connections
and
very
important
insurance
Insurance
is
key
All
we
need
now
are
the
superest
superheroes
It
needs
you
three
Come
on
Help
me
make
all
Supers
legal
again
This
sounds
great
Let's
get
this
going
What's
my
first
assignment
That
enthusiasm
is
golden
CHUCKLING
Well
Elastigirl
is
our
best
play
Better
than
me
CLEARS
THROAT
I
mean
she's
good
STAMMERING
Really
a
credit
to
her
You
know
CHUCKLES
NERVOUSLY
You
know
With
great
respect
let's
not
test
the
whole
insurancewillpay
foreverything
idea
on
the
first
go
'round
okay
FROZONE
CHUCKLES
Wait
a
minute
You're
sayin'
what
I'm
messy
Well
Evelyn
did
a
costbenefit
analysis
comparin'
all
your
last
five
years
of
crime
fightin'
before
going
underground
And's
Elastigirl's
numbers
are
selfexplanatory
Well
it's
not
a
fair
comparison
Heavyweight
problems
need
heavyweight
solutions
Of
course
We're
gonna
solve
all
kinds
of
problems
together
After
the
perfect
launch
with
Elastigirl
So
what
do
you
say
What
do
I
say
CHUCKLES
I
don't
know
What
do
you
mean
you
don't
know
A
few
hours
ago
you
were
saying
it
was
over
and
being
a
superhero
was
a
fantasy
Now
you
get
the
offer
of
a
lifetime
and
you
don't
know
It's
not
that
simple
Bob
I
wanna
protect
the
kids
So
do
I
From
jail
Bob
SPITS
BOB
And
how
do
you
do
that
By
turning
down
a
chance
to
change
the
law
that
forces
them
to
hide
what
they
are
They
haven't
decided
what
they
are
They're
still
kids
Kids
with
powers
which
makes
them
Supers
whether
they
decide
to
use
those
powers
or
not
This
will
benefit
them
It's
not
a
good
time
to
be
away
Dash
is
having
trouble
with
homework
Vi
is
worried
about
her
first
date
with
that
boy
she
likes
Tony
and
JackJack
JackJack
What's
wrong
with
him
Okay
nothing's
wrong
with
JackJack
But
even
a
normal
baby
needs
a
lot
of
attention
I'm
just
not
sure
I
can
leave
Of
course
you
can
leave
You've
got
to
So
that
I
we
can
be
Supers
again
so
our
kids
can
have
that
choice
SCOFFS
So
you
can
have
that
choice
All
right
yes
So
I
can
have
that
choice
And
I
would
do
a
great
job
Regardless
of
what
Deavor's
pie
charts
or
whatever
But
they
want
you
STRAINED
Any
you'll
do
a
great
job
too
INHALES
SHARPLY
Well
that
was
excruciating
to
watch
CHUCKLES
I
can't
lie
to
you
It's
nice
to
be
wanted
Flattering
you
know
but
But
what's
the
choice
One
do
this
right
get
well
paid
we're
outta
the
motel
and
things
get
better
for
all
Supers
including
our
kids
Or
two
I
find
a
job
in
two
weeks
or
we're
homeless
You
know
it's
crazy
right
To
help
my
family
I
gotta
leave
it
To
fix
the
law
I
gotta
break
it
You'll
be
great
I
know
I
will
But
what
about
you
We
have
kids
I'll
watch
the
kids
no
problem
Easy
Easy
huh
You're
adorable
Well
if
there
is
a
problem
I'll
drop
this
thing
and
come
right
back
You
won't
need
to
I
got
it
you
go
do
this
thing
Do
it
so
I
can
do
it
better
GRUNTS

Can't

Look

this
place
Deaver
bought
it
from
an
eccentric
billionaire
who
liked
to
come
and
go
without
being
seen
so
the
house
has
multiple
hidden
exits
Good
thing
we
won't
stand
out
Wouldn't
want
to
attract
any
unnecessary
attention
DASH

Nah
I
beg
to
differ
I'm

I'm
not

you

greater

Which
side
of
me
are
you
askin'
The
believer
or
the
cynic
The
cynic
Would
say
selling
is
more
important
because
the
best
sellers
have
the
most
buyers
Doesn't
matter
what
you're
sellin'
It
only
matters
what
people
buy
This
is
true
If
I
discovered
the
origin
of
the
universe
my
brother
would
find
a
way
to
market
it
as
a
uh
foot
massager
BOTH
LAUGHING
So
what
would
the

say
The

would
tell
you
to
make
your

Don't
wait
for

assert
yourself
and
impose
your
will
on
the
status
quo
Sounds

You

I'm

The

checked

out
STAMMERS
I
have
no
memory
of
the
event
I
gotta
tell
you
it's
pretty
strange
to
see
a
recording
of
yourself
the
night
before
and
have
no
recollection
I
don't
think
anyone
needs
to
worry
We've
taken
many
precautions
tonight
though
Where
are
you
right
now
On
a
case
in
a
secure
undisclosed
location
CHAD
I
wanna
talk
about
you
startin'
with
your
save
of
a
runaway

Here's
an
exclusive
unedited

from

Roll

I'll

She
knew
Let's
see
if
your
gadget
works
Don't
bother
watching
the
rest
Gotcha
Elastigirl
doesn't
save
the
say
She
only
postpones
her
defeat
And
while
she
postpones
her
defeat
you
eat
chips
and
watch
her
confront
problems
that
you
are
too
lazy
to
deal
with
Superheroes
are
part
of
your
brainless
desire
to
replace
true
experience
with
simulation
You
don't
talk
you
watch
talk
shows
You
don't
play
games
you
watch
game
shows
Travel
relationships
risk
every
meaningful
experience
must
be
packaged
and
delivered
to
you
to
watch
at
a
distance
So
that
you
can
remain
ever
sheltered
ever
passive
ever
ravenous
consumers
who
can't
bring
themselves
to
rise
from
their
couches
break
a
sweat
and
participate
in
life
You
want
superheroes
to
protect
you
and
make
yourselves
ever
more
powerless
in
the
process
While
you
tell
yourselves
you're
being
looked
after
That
your
interests
are
being
served
And
your
rights
are
being
upheld
So
that
the
system
can
keep
stealin'
on
from
you
smilin'
at
you
all
the
while
Go
ahead
send
your
Supers
to

Grab
your

watch

What
Isn't
the

cam
closed

It
is
Then
how
come
Screenslaver
has
it
Maybe
he
hacked
it
So
he's
sophisticated
enough
to
do
that
but
he
has
simple
locks
on
his
doors
Maybe
he
wanted
you
to
find
him
He
wanted
to
get
caught
He
wanted
you
to
win
That
makes
no
sense
He's
a
brilliant
guy
If
he's
smart
enough
to
conceive
of
technology
like
this
he's
smart
enough
to
think
of
something
to
do
with
it

we

doesn't

no

over

yes
Huh
That
sums

Oh
Lord
STAMMERS
What
is
he
doing
Well
it's
Mozart
Robert
Can
you
blame
him
The
important
thing
is
that
the
suit
and

anticipated
the
change
and
alerted
you
Oh
no
Cookies
I
gotta
get
cookies
You
do
not

I
learned
quite

last

any

will
inevitably
result
in

imminent
What
does
that
mean
YELPS
It
means

Robert
for
which
the

countermeasures

you

I

doubtlessly
exceeded
your

the

contain

Try

So
you're

Yes
and
no
Let's

I

the

Does
Winston
know

That
I'm
the
Screenslaver
Of

not
Can
you
imagine
what
Mr

would
do
with
my
hypnosis
technology
Worse
than
what
you're
doin'
Hey
I'm
using
the
technology
to
destroy
people's
trust
in
it
Like
I'm
using

did
I
put

Pizza

Seemed

gave

I
should

I
gave
you
a
pretty
good

through
him

But
it
doesn't
bother
you
that
an
innocent
man
is
in
jail
Eh
he
was
surly
and
the
pizza
was
cold
I
counted
on
you
That's
why
you
failed
What
Why
would
you
count
on
me
Because
I
built
you
a
bike
Because
my
brother
knows
the
words
to
your
theme
song
We
don't
know
each
other
But
you
can
count
on
me
anyway
I
am
supposed
to
aren't
I
Because
you
have
some
strange
abilities
and
a
shiny
costume
the
rest
of
us
are
supposed
to
put
our
lives
into
your
gloved
hands
That's
what
my
father
believed
When
our
home
was
broken
into
my
mother
wanted
to
hide
Begged
my
father
to
use
the
safe
room
But
Father
insisted
they
call
his
superhero
friends
He
died
pointlessly
stupidly
waiting
for
heroes
to
save
the
day
But
why
would
you
Your
brother
Is
a
child
He
remembers
the
time
when
the
has
parents
and
superheroes
So
like
a
child
Winston
conflates
the
two
Mommy
and
Daddy
went
away
because
supers
went
away
Our
sweet
parents
were
fools
to
put
their
lives
in
anybody
else's
hands
Superheroes
keep
us
weak
Are
you
gonna
kill

Hah
Using
you

You're
